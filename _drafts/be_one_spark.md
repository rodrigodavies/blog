What am I looking for in an innovative crowdfunding project?

So if your product doesn't ship as fast you want it to and you have to make some unexpected changes to the design, that's ok – and it's ok with your backers. To most people, innovation isn't about turn-key, off-the-shelf solutions, it's about figuring out what works by doing it, iterating as you go along. Great campaigns make the case for that kind of work and invite their backers to be a part of the the process. That's why, when done right, crowdfunding is an invaluable platform for innovation.
