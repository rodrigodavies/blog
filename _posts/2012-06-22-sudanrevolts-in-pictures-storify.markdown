Protests in Sudan entered their sixth day today, and although events are still going somewhat [under-reported by the international media](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&gl=in&tbm=nws&q=sudan%2Bprotests%2Bnews) ([Al Jazeera](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=2&ved=0CDoQqQIwAQ&url=http%3A%2F%2Fstream.aljazeera.com%2Fstory%2Fstudents-lead-sudanrevolts-against-austerity-0022253&ei=cPfkT8awCsaN0wXmq_0w&usg=AFQjCNGcsF7Km1TU5NFfJV3vizjBR96o0g) and [Reuters](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/22/us-sudan-protest-idUSBRE85L12120120622) being among the few to provide sustained coverage), the number of videos and photos appearing under the [#sudanrevolts](https://twitter.com/search/%23sudanrevolts) tag is increasing exponentially. Most images were grainy and from the street, but there were a few high-quality photos, and several portraits of the activists who have been arrested. I started collecting them today in this Storify project, [#SudanRevolts in pictures](http://storify.com/rodrigodavies/sudanrevolts-in-pictures) (I've left out the images of supporters from outside Sudan, of which they are many). I'll continue to update as quickly as I can, but if you've used Storify before and want to help, let me know.

The flow of information could be choked off at any moment, as rumours continue to circulate that the Sudanese authorities are preparing to shut down the internet. [Instructions on how to use Speak to Tweet were being circulated](https://twitter.com/divadalliaa/status/216183012927344641) in preparation for a shut-down - a service that was originally set up to help activists in Egypt. Other users were posting instructions on how to use Twitter's SMS to Tweet facility, but since the country's telephone operators are state-controlled, [this is probably not be a secure option](https://twitter.com/zolsudani/status/216311350559903745).

New York Times columnist [Nick Krystof](https://twitter.com/NickKristof/status/216295032083324929) isn't alone in wondering whether this could be the beginning of the end for Bashir.
