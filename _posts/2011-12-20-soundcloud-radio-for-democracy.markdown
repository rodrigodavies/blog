Soundcloud has always been a great platform, and it's now one of three platforms being used by an [Open Society](http://www.osiwa.org/) initiative to create radio stations across West Africa. According to this story, West Africa Radio for Democracy is taking a BBC/NPR style approach to programming, airing investigative pieces and regular news. The use of streaming services mean that radio's extensive reach can be harnessed at a much lower cost.
