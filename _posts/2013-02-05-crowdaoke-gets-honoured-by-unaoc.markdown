I'm delighted to report that [Crowdaoke](http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2012/11/29/crowdaoke-building-peace-through-harmony/), the karaoke platform concept I was working on last year with Helena Puig Larrauri and Heidi Rosbe, [received an 'honourable mention' in the United Nations' Alliance of Civilizations' CREATE UNAOC competition](http://www.unaoc.org/2013/01/announcing-the-create-uanoc-2012-finalists/).

Thanks to everyone who provided their support and advice during the process, and we hope to be able to work further on [Crowdaoke](http://www.rodrigodavies.com/crowdaoke/) later this year.

In the meantime, best of luck to the five finalists - we're looking forward to seeing the results of their fantastic proposals.
