The purpose of this project is to collect data related to civic crowdfunding and to advance social research into the field. I'm currently pursuing my master's thesis and will be compiling the research that appears here into a series of academic papers, articles and blog posts.

You can subscribe to email updates on the project below, or follow the [#civiccrowdfunding](https://twitter.com/search?q=civiccrowdfunding) twitter hashtag (I tweet [@rodrigodavies](http://twitter.com/rodrigodavies)). Are you a researcher who'd like to join the project? [Let's talk](mailto:rodrigo.davies@gmail.com?subject=Civic Crowdfunding Research Project).
