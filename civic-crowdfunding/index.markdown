<img src="logo_white.png" class="nocircle"> Welcome to the Civic Crowdfunding Research Project. The purpose of this project is to collect data related to civic crowdfunding and to advance social research into the field. I'm currently pursuing my master's thesis and will be compiling the research that appears here into a series of academic papers, articles and blog posts.

You can subscribe to email updates on the project using the form below, or follow the [#civiccrowdfunding](https://twitter.com/search?q=civiccrowdfunding) twitter hashtag (I tweet [@rodrigodavies](http://twitter.com/rodrigodavies)). Are you a researcher who'd like to join the project? [Let's talk](mailto:rodrigo.davies@gmail.com?subject=Civic Crowdfunding Research Project).

The posts below are from my blog unless otherwise stated, and are a selection taken from the [crowdfunding tag](http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/tag/crowdfunding/). Many of the articles are cross-posted at the [Center for Civic Media](http://civic.mit.edu/users/rodrigodavies) blog and [PBS Idea Lab](http://www.pbs.org/idealab/author/rdavies/). I also contribute to related collections on Alternative Infrastructures at [Medium](https://medium.com/alternative-infrastructures) and [HASTAC](http://www.hastac.org/groups/alternative-infrastructures).
