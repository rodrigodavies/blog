<h2>About the Civic Crowdfunding Research Project</h2>

The Civic Crowdfunding Project was founded by Rodrigo Davies, a Research Assistant at MIT's <a href="http://civic.mit.edu">Center for Civic Media</a>. I'm currently pursuing my master's thesis and will be compiling the research that appears here into a series of academic papers, articles and blog posts. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/about">You can read more about my background here</a>.

If you're interested in contributing to the project, <a href="mailto:rodrigo@civiccrowdfunding.com">contact me</a>.

The CCRP logo was adapted from <a href="http://thenounproject.com/noun/institution/#icon-No11638" target="_blank">Institution</a> by <a href="http://thenounproject.com/diegochavez" target="_blank">Diego Chavez</a> at the Noun Project.
