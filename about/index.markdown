[![Rodrigo Davies - Photo by Nicole Freedman](rodrigo_hshot.png)](http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rodrigo_hshot.png)This is a blog about how technology and media impact communities and governments, and the ways they are adapting to new challenges and opportunities. You can also read the [tweet](http://twitter.com/rodrigodavies)-length version.

I'm based in Cambridge, Massachusetts as a Research Assistant at MIT's [Center for Civic Media](http://civic.mit.edu) and an MS student in the [Comparative Media Studies](http://cms.mit.edu) program.

My research interests are the use of [crowdfunding for civic projects](http://www.civiccrowdfunding.com), the impact of social media on political discourse, [ICT4D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development) and [user-centered design](http://calltoaction.mit.edu). My current projects include [Build Peace](http://howtobuildpeace.org), a conference on new technologies for peacebuilding, [Call to Action](http://calltoaction.mit.edu), a design platform for VoIP services and [Fresh Food Boston](http://freshfoodboston.newurbanmechanics.org), a web and mobile platform to encourage the city's youth to eat healthily. 

<!--- I'm a HASTAC Scholar and [write about some of my work](http://www.hastac.org/blogs/rodrigodavies) as part of the Alternative Infrastructures group, which I co-founded with [Eduardo Marisca](http://www.mutaciones.pe). -->

Previously I was a Summer Innovation Fellow at the San Francisco [Mayor's Office of Civic Innovation](http://www.innovatesf.com), advised the London-based crowdfunding platform [Spacehive](http://www.spacehive.com) and was a consultant to the United Nations Development Program. I have also worked with [GQ India](http://www.gqindia.com), the BBC and Bloomberg (see my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigodavies) profile).

In my spare time I am one third of the [Idioterne](http://mumbaiboss.com/2010/10/29/idiotville/) DJ collective, and we maintain a
[Spotify playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/rodrigodavies/playlist/08hQfk1B8TP6vvof4c75ze) that you can subscribe to (if you're in one of the 15 countries the platform operates in). You can also [stream some of my previous live DJ sets and recorded mixes](/blog/music/).
