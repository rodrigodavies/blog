[![Rodrigo Davies - Photo by Nicole Freedman](rodrigo_hshot.png)](http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/rodrigo_hshot.png)This is a blog about how technology and media impact communities and governments, and the ways they are adapting to new challenges and opportunities. You can also read the [tweet](http://twitter.com/rodrigodavies)-length version.

I'm based in San Francisco as a doctoral student and researcher at Stanford in the [Work, Technology and Organizations group](http://web.stanford.edu/group/wto/cgi-bin/wp/students/), in the department of Management Science and Engineering. I'm also a Research Affiliate at MIT's [Center for Civic Media](http://civic.mit.edu), where I was previously an MS student in the [Comparative Media Studies](http://cms.mit.edu) program.

My research interests are the use of [crowdfunding for civic projects](http://www.civiccrowdfunding.com), crowdsourcing in organizations, [ICT4D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communication_technologies_for_development) and [user-centered design](http://calltoaction.mit.edu). My [current projects](../projects/) include a crowdfunding research group, a conference on new technologies for peacebuilding, and an interactive workshop for entrepreneurs in developing economies. 

In the past I have been a Summer Innovation Fellow at the San Francisco [Mayor's Office of Civic Innovation](http://www.innovatesf.com), advised the London-based crowdfunding platform [Spacehive](http://www.spacehive.com) and been a consultant to the United Nations Development Program. I have also worked with Conde Nast India, the BBC and Bloomberg (see my [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigodavies) profile).

In my spare time I am one third of the [Idioterne](http://mumbaiboss.com/2010/10/29/idiotville/) DJ collective, and we maintain a
[Spotify playlist](http://open.spotify.com/user/rodrigodavies/playlist/08hQfk1B8TP6vvof4c75ze) that you can subscribe to (if you're in one of the 15 countries the platform operates in). You can also [stream some of my previous live DJ sets and recorded mixes](/blog/music/).
