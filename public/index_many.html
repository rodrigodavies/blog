		Three Provocations for Civic Crowdfunding
		<p><img src="/img/3.png" alt="http://www.fotopedia.com/users/R53-8VoCz0M" /></p>

<p>This week I’m in Daegu, Korea, and on Thursday (23rd October) will be giving a talk at the annual <a href="http://ir15.aoir.org/">Association of Internet Researchers conference (AoIR)</a>, titled “Three Provocations for Civic Crowdfunding.” If you’re in Daegu, do stop by the session or find me around the event. If you’re not in Daegu, I’ll update this post with my slides before Thursday.</p>

<p>I’m excited to be part of a panel called “Commodification and Crowdsourcing”, with <a href="http://wishcrys.com/">Crystal Abidin</a>, <a href="http://dbrabham.wordpress.com/">Daren Brabham</a> and <a href="http://www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=608&amp;f_id=35">Andrew Herman</a>. Daren is one of the few other researchers I’ve found who is paying attention to the sociological aspects of crowdfunding, and he’s going to be talking about the impact of crowdfunding discourse on public funding for the arts. </p>

<p>Since AoIR format is short papers, I’ve included the full text below. An extended version will hopefully be appearing in print over the next few months.</p>

<p><em>Three Provocations for Civic Crowdfunding: AoIR 15, Daegu, Korea</em></p>

<p>The rapid rise of crowdfunding in the past five years, most prominently among US-based platforms such as Kickstarter and IndieGoGo, has begun to attract the attention of a wide range of scholars, policymakers and practitioners. As the industry evolves, it is developing a range of specialist sub-genres and platforms, from politics to manufacturing. This paper considers civic crowdfunding – the use of crowdfunding for projects that produce community or quasi-public assets – and argues that its emergence demands a fresh set of questions and approaches.</p>

<p>Scholarly analyses of crowdfunding to date have centered on fields such as investment finance, and Computer-Supported Co-operative Work (CSCW). While these inquiries have begun to build a frameworks for understanding the dynamics of the fundraising process and participants’ motivations, there is yet to be substantial work considering the socio-political context and broader implications of crowdfunding. These questions are necessarily more pressing and contested when considering the use of crowdfunding for civic projects. The sub-field of `civic crowdfunding’ as an application of the model is yet to be defined by academic researchers. The use of the term can be traced to 2012, and is used by platforms such as Spacehive and Neighbor.ly (Davies 2014a). This paper uses a mixed-methods case study approach to highlight and analyze critical cases in civic crowdfunding. It draws on quantitative analysis of project fundraising data drawn from four platforms (Citizinvestor, IOBY, Neighbo.ly and Spacehive), participant interviews and discourse analysis of projects’ promotional material. In so doing it posits three provocations for the future study of civic crowdfunding. </p>

<p>Firstly, to what extent is civic crowdfunding participatory? It can be a truly organic mechanism that is a new tool available to activists. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the graffiti artist Mundano raised $27,000 on the Catarse platform in May 2012 — twice the campaign’s original target — to paint the carts of waste pickers, as a means of highlighting their contribution to the city’s environmental sustainability and advocating for new labor protections for them. The idea that crowdfunding is a form of participation as well as a funding mechanism is salient since civic crowdfunding has emerged after a decade of experimentation with symbolic money as a representation of agency through participatory budgeting, most prominently in Brazil and New York City. But most crowdfunding platforms do not support the kind of deliberative process that would be expected in a participatory democratic structure: by the time a campaign is published on a platform, the idea is expected to be fully formed. Furthemore, since donations vary in size and offer differential agencies, the field is open to the charge that it may become dominated by resourced interests. Several of the largest civic crowdfunding campaigns to date have drawn the majority of their funding not from a high volume, low-donation value crowd, but from wealthier donors. For example, Kansas City’s B-Cycle program, partially crowdfunded on Neighbor.ly, drew 99% of its funding from six backers who donated more than $5,000 each.</p>

<p>Secondly, does civic crowdfunding exacerbate or reduce economic inequality? At the case level, there are clear examples of underserved and privileged communities benefiting from civic crowdfunding in very different ways. In Glyn Coch, South Wales, a community with chronic unemployment and resource challenges, local organizers raised $49,000 to fill a gap in funding for a new community center, most of which was funded by government grants. By contrast, in October 2013, three wealthy suburban communities in Oakland, CA, raised $50,000 on the CrowdTilt platform to crowdfund private security patrols. The campaigns, which emerged within a few days of each other, demonstrated the risk of a ‘contagion effect’ through which resourced communities could use civic crowdfunding campaigns from other localities as templates for building their replacement public services. At the platform level there are more ambiguous indicators with respect to equity. New York and Miami-based platform IOBY is the only platform that explicitly recruits projects from underserved communities. Early findings suggest that IOBY projects occur in neighborhoods with slightly higher poverty rates, but the difference is marginal (Goodspeed and Davies 2014). Citizinvestor finds in its own data that there is no correlation between the likelihood of a project occurring in a neighborhood and that neighborhood’s average household income. </p>

<p>Thirdly, does civic crowdfunding support or undermine the role of public institutions? In many cases the link between civic crowdfunding and weakened institutions is direct: The bankrupt city of Central Falls, Rhode Island, crowdfunded $20,000 to pay for recycling facilities in Jenks park in November 2013, explicitly citing its financial distress as a motivating factor. Around one in ten projects in the dataset makes reference to shortfalls in public funding, and Brabham has argued that the success of crowdfunding is likely to be a disincentive for public investment in the arts in the future (Davies 2014b, Brabham 2012). Yet on the other hand, civic crowdfunding can also be framed as a mechanism that expands the range of public-private partnerships that are possible, since government can partner with crowdfunded groups. Parklets, a system of allowing individuals and groups to create temporary installations in parking spaces, is one public-private framework that has benefited from crowdfunding. Eleven parklets have been successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter since April 2012, in Oakland, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Vancouver, raising a total of $100,853. In August 2013, the City of San Francisco launched Living Innovation Zones, a program modeled on parklets that invites proposals for a series of underutilized spaces across the city, and encourages prospective groups to consider crowdfunding. Public-private opportunities that embrace crowdfunding as a potential tool are nascent, but are gaining in popularity.</p>

<p>Each of these three provocations is highly context-specific and as yet the signals from the available data and reported cases are mixed and often conflicting. Nevertheless, they underscore the importance of approaching civic crowdfunding as a socio-politically located and contested phenomenon, and offer pathways for researchers to begin to critically analyze and define the field. Future research work on civic crowdfunding that considers its institutional and political context is likely to be highly generative across disciplines.</p>

		Crowdfunding Cities as Collaborative Innovation
		<p><img src="/img/merge.png" alt="http://www.fotopedia.com/users/R53-8VoCz0M" /></p>

<p>Today at the Academy of Management’s Annual Meeting in Philadelphia some colleagues and I will be giving a panel titled <a href="http://program.aom.org/2014/submission.asp?mode=ShowSession&amp;SessionID=1026">Towards Government 2.0: Open Data and Innovation through Cross-Sector Collaboration</a>. We’re going to be talking about open data, building better and more open government services, and how to foster civic collaboration across sectors. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I won’t be at the meeting in person (I’m in the midst of relocating to San Francisco), so I’ve contributed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbnQHKdIwLY">a video</a> in which I talk about some of the work I’ve done on crowdfunding in cities. </p>

<p>I’m interested in how crowdfunding can be a means not just of getting something done (i.e. a funding mechanism), but a means of getting something done in a particular way: collaboratively. </p>

<p>The crowd in a crowdfunding campaign collaborates ambiently – by contributing in the same place, they benefit from mutual awareness and together create a movement that has momentum. But in civic crowdfunding there’s also another layer of possible collaboration, between the crowd and cities, because cities are likely to have an interest in almost any project that provides a service to a local community. That interest could be regulatory (the city regulates the use of a particular kind of space or activity), or it could be participatory (the city wants to know what’s going on and to support good ideas). Those interests could be construed positively or negatively, depending on the relationship between the city and the project participants – the city could be perceived as supportive and welcoming, or heavy-handed and interfering.</p>

<p>Crowdfunding has the potential to help structure those relationships positively, if cities and project owners approach the project in the right way. The substance of my talk, which you can check out below, is to give four suggestions for how cities can frame structure their involvement in civic crowdfunding projects to deliver the best outcomes. You’ll also be able to read more on this in <a href="http://rodrigodavies.com/civiccrowdfunding">an upcoming collection I’m contributing to on Smarter Cities</a>, edited by <a href="http://www.esade.edu/faculty/esteve.almirall">Esteve Almirall</a> and <a href="http://boydcohen.com">Boyd Cohen</a>. </p>

		What's Crowdfunding (and What's Not)
		<p><img src="/img/lonely.png" alt="http://www.fotopedia.com/users/R53-8VoCz0M" /></p>

<p>Recently I came across a fundraising campaign by a consortium of non-profits in the US earlier this year to raise money over a short period of time. Participating organizations were ranked in a public ranking, and competed for prizes based on the amount they raised and the number of donors they attracted. A running total of the overall amount donated was published on the site. The effort was fairly successful, and raised close to a million dollars for over 300 organizations. The most successful organization raised over $25,000, although one-fifth of participating organizations raised zero.</p>

<p>The initiative was described to me as being similar to crowdfunding, likely because of its gamified flavor. Although the folks behind it weren’t using the language of crowdfunding, several observers were. But it wasn’t crowdfunding, and there are a number of important reasons why.</p>

<p>Before I get into that, let’s be clear: I’m not making a point about the technical definition of the term <em>crowdfunding</em>. My critique is not that this initiative missed many opportunities to create a compelling campaign that crowdfunders and crowdfunding platforms make use of every day. The following criticisms are not specific to this case, either. They’re common problems among inexperienced (and reluctant) online fundraisers, particularly in the non-profit space. That’s why I’m not going to name the initiative here, instead I’m going to refer to it as Acme Non-Profit Initiative. </p>

<p>Here are the biggest problems I observed.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>There was no crowd</strong>. One of the main distinguishing elements of crowdfunding is the mutual awareness of donors. It’s what reminds us that we’re not acting alone (breaking down ‘pluralistic ignorance’), and gives us a sense of belonging. Acme Non-Profit Initiative’s website did not show any identifying information about other donors, simply the numbers. It was not, as far as I can tell, able to interface with donors’ Facebook and Twitter accounts directly to enable them to see which of their friends had already donated. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>There were no projects</strong>. The prompt for donation was a one paragraph description of the organization, with a selection of links. There was no clear sense of what projects the organizations were raising money for at this particular time, and what stage they were at. It’s not true that crowdfunding can never be used to pay for overhead costs. If these costs are given as part of a project budget, backers won’t flee. Backers understand that it costs money to keep the lights on, but they’re most interested what’s happening in the building. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>There were no targets</strong>. Besides a number of prizes given to the most successful organizations, there was no sense of what the organizations and the crowd should be aiming for. As a result, there were no metrics for success and no sense of achievement, no matter how well the initiative went. Having the courage to set a target and asking the crowd to help you reach it is part of the interaction and engagement that crowdfunding demands. You’re asking the crowd to take a risk with you by backing your project, and in return your organization is taking a risk by putting its goals and ideas out in public.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>The donation data wasn’t transparent</strong>. I found that the total fundraising numbers being reported didn’t correspond with the itemized data. I presume that’s because additional funds were raised during the initiative but given directly, instead of through the platforms. That’s not unusual, but it raises red flags with potential donors when organizations provide incomplete data. A simple line that explained that a certain percentage of funds were given directly or in person would be enough. Being loose with the published numbers undermines the credibility of the initiative and doesn’t meet the standards of transparency people rightly associate with crowdfunding. We should continue to demand that. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As crowdfunding increasingly becomes used as a catch-all term for all kinds of online fundraising, we’re in danger of missing the point. That danger particularly applies to organizations who already fundraise regularly, and may be under the impression that all they need to do to take advantage of crowdfunding is to digitize, verbatim, their existing processes. The history of technological change has taught us time after time that that won’t work. New technologies reshape and restructure processes and organizations, whether they like it or not. And, <a href="http://www.philanthropy.blogspot.com/2014/05/civil-society-is-missing-boat-on-issues.html">as Lucy Bernholz put it recently</a>, we’re foolish to think that non-profits will be any different. </p>

<p>While it’s great to see so many innovative twists on the crowdfunding model emerge, we need to be sure that we’re not calling things crowdfunding that are really not worthy of the term – and then being disappointed when those initiatives don’t deliver the engagement their creators are hoping for. When done correctly, crowdfunding is bold, risky and open, and it demands those same qualities from backers and creators alike. </p>

		Civic Crowdfunding – Four Things We Know, Two Things We Don't
		<p><img src="/img/thesis.jpg" alt="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2434615" /></p>

<p>Today I’m capping <a href="http://rodrigodavies.com/civiccrowdfunding/">two years of studying the emergence of civic crowdfunding</a> by submitting my master’s thesis to the MIT archives. Great thanks are due to the wonderful collaborators I’ve had the privilege of working with. I won’t name everyone here, but all of you folks will find your names in the Acknowledgments section.</p>

<p>You can read <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2434615">Civic Crowdfunding: Participatory Communities, Entrepreneurs and the Political Economy of Place</a> in its entirety (173 pages) now, and if you do so, I’d love to hear your feedback. Before you get to that, though, here are some of the most important things I learned about civic crowdfunding, and a few thoughts on where we’re headed next.</p>

<p>Crowdfunding is everywhere. People are using it to fund watches, comic books, even famous film directors are doing it. In what is now a $6 billion industry globally, I think the most interesting, disruptive and exciting work that’s happening is in donation-based crowdfunding. That’s worth, very roughly, $1.2 billion a year worldwide per year. Within that subset, I’ve been looking at civic projects, people who are producing shared goods for a community or broader public. These projects build on <a href="http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2014/04/28/the-digital-pollada-or-what-i-learned-about-crowdfunding-from-peruvian-chicken.html">histories of community fundraising and resource pooling that long predate the Internet</a>; what’s changed is that we’ve created a scalable, portable platform model to carry out these existing practices.</p>

<p>So how is civic crowdfunding doing? When I started this project very few people were using that term. No one had done any aggregated data collection and published it. So I decided to take on that task. I collected data on 1224 projects between 2010 and March 2014, which raised $10.74 million in just over three years. I focused on seven platforms: Catarse (Brazil), Citizinvestor (US), Goteo (Spain), IOBY (US), Kickstarter (US), Neighbor.ly (US) and Spacehive (UK). I didn’t collect everything. There’s a new crowdfunding site every week that may or may not have a few civic projects on it. If you’re interested in my methodology, check out Chapter 2. I don’t pretend to have captured every civic project that has ever existed, but I’m working with a representative sample. </p>

<p>Here are four things I found out about civic crowdfunding. </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Civic crowdfunding is small-scale but relatively successful, and it has big ambitions.</strong> Currently the average civic crowdfunding project is small in scale: $6,357 is the median amount raised. But these civic projects seem to be doing pretty well. Projects tagged ‘civic’ on Kickstarter, for instance, succeed 81% of the time. If Civic were a separate category, it would be Kickstarter’s most successful category. Meanwhile, most platform owners and some incumbent institutions see civic crowdfunding as a new mechanism for public-private partnerships capable of realizing large-scale projects. In a small minority of cases, such as the three edge-case projects I explored in Chapter 3 of my thesis, civic crowdfunding has begun to fulfill some of those ambitions. For the center of gravity to shift further in the direction of these potential outcomes, though, existing institutions, including government, large non-profits and the for-profit sector, will need to engage more comprehensively with the process. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Civic crowdfunding started as a hobby for green space projects by local non-profits, but larger organizations are getting involved.</strong> Almost a third of campaigners are using civic crowdfunding platforms for park and garden-related projects (29%). Event-based projects, and education and training are also popular. Sports and mobility projects are pretty uncommon. The frequency of garden and park projects is partly because these projects are not capital intensive, and they’re uncontroversial. That’s also changing. Organizations from governments to corporations and large foundations, are exploring ways to support crowdfunding for <a href="http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2014/03/24/hawaii-proposes-the-first-civic-crowdfunding-bill.html">a much wider range of community-facing activities</a>. Their modes of engagement include <a href="http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2013/07/23/four-roles-civic-organizations-can-play-in-crowdfunding.html">publicizing campaigns, match-funding campaigns on an ad-hoc basis, running their own campaigns and even building new platforms from the ground up</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Civic crowdfunding is concentrated in cities (especially those where platforms are based).</strong> The genre is too new to have spread very effectively, it seems. Five states account for 80% of the projects, and this is partly a function of where the platforms are located. New York, California are our top two, followed by Illinois and Oregon. We know there’s a strong trend towards big cities. It’s hard work for communities to use crowdfunding to get projects off the ground, especially when it’s an unfamiliar process. The platforms have played a critical role in building participants’ understanding of crowdfunding and supporting them through the process. </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Civic crowdfunding has the same highly unequal distributional tendencies as other crowd markets.</strong> When we look at the size distribution of projects, the first thing we notice is something close to a Pareto distribution, or Long Tail. Most projects are small-scale, but a small number of high-value projects have taken a large share of the total revenue raised by civic crowdfunding. We shouldn’t be surprised by this. On Kickstarter most successful projects are between 5 and 10k, and 47% of civic projects I studied are in the same bracket. <a href="http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2013/11/21/spreading-the-crowdfunded-wealth.html">The problem is that we tend to remember the outliers, such as Veronica Mars and Spike Lee – because they show what’s possible</a>. But they are still the outliers. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, here are two things we don’t know. </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Will civic crowdfunding deter public investment or encourage it?</strong> </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Will civic crowdfunding widen wealth gaps?</strong> </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We don’t have enough high-quality data, and not enough time has passed, to answer these questions satisfactorily yet. There are some clues in the rhetoric people use, which I explore in Chapter 4 of my thesis, but <a href="http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2014/03/23/is-civic-crowdfunding-participatory-citizenship-or-a-sign-of-institutions-in-decline.html">they point in many different, contradictory directions</a>. Nevertheless, there are concrete goals we can work towards to try and make the answers to those two questions positive ones for community development and society more broadly.</p>

<p>Communities and the groups that serve them, in the government and social sector, are in an important position to influence how crowdfunding evolves. It can just as easily become a part of the toolkit for community organizing and be a mechanism for getting resources to places where they’re needed as it can be to do the opposite. I’ve been involved as a workshop leader and advisor in trying to help support some of this activity, but we’re really just getting started. </p>

<p>To really understand what’s going on, especially over the longer term, we need better data. We need to know more precisely when projects are happening, if they’re succeeding, and by what measure. And we need to be able to know how what’s happening in crowdfunding relates to the other things we measure. We can’t build civic engagement and awareness on the back of bad data. This is something I’m actively working on with the platforms I’ve worked with. </p>

<p>Finally, we need more socially-grounded research in this space. It’s one of the things I’m going to be spending my time on at Stanford over the next five years. I’m excited about advancing qualitative inquiry to support the quantitative analysis we’re doing, research that helps us understand how crowdfunding is changing the ways that organizations and the people within them work. We know crowdfunding is not just a numbers game, it’s a very human and complex game, and I look forward to continuing to help us understand it better.</p>
