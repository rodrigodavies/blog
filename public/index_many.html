		A New Way to Invest in Communities
		<p><img src="/blog/img/ggb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>For the past couple of years I&#39;ve been thinking about how to bring the energy, potential and ambition of donation/reward crowdfunding to community development and civic engagement. I was lucky to be an early employee of <a href="http://www.spacehive.com">Spacehive</a>, one of the first movers in the space, I put together the first <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2434615">study of the field</a> (with the help of <a href="http://civiccrowdfunding.com">Ethan</a> and others at MIT), and I got to watch as the idea of civic crowdfunding caught the attention of the media, researchers, and finally, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-hails-the-rise-of-civic-crowdfunding">heads of state</a>. I got to watch some incredible people <a href="http://spacehive.com/glyncochcc">make change for their neighborhoods</a> and <a href="http://catarse.me/pt/pimpmycarroca">their communities</a>.</p>

<p>But there were two questions that often gave me pause. First, should we be funding civic projects through philanthropy, and does the success of that undermine public investment? Second, is it realistic to expect philanthropic crowds to raise the large sums that are often necessary to improve a community&#39;s quality of life? </p>

<p>The first question is a judgement call for which I&#39;ve seen persuasive arguments on both sides. On the second question, I&#39;ve seen very few cases that persuade me that the answer is yes. That&#39;s not to say donation/reward civic crowdfunding doesn&#39;t have a bright future in some respects. It has proven itself to be a robust way to produce small-scale change, especially in urban communities. As I&#39;ve argued many times before, if non-profits start to take donation/reward crowdfunding seriously as a tactic, it has the potential to transform that sector and energize a whole new generation of small-dollar philanthropists. I will continue to work with and advise organizations who are considering donation-based civic crowdfunding for the right projects.</p>

<p>However, there are other methods of financing community development that can give a much stronger &#39;yes&#39; to that second question, the question of scale. One of those is a very old form of crowd-based finance: municipal bonds. For just over two centuries, U.S. cities have been using them to finance critical improvements, from transport infrastructure, to schools, to the <a href="http://goldengatebridge.org/research/BondMeasure.php">Golden Gate Bridge</a>. Municipal bonds give individuals the opportunity to invest in improvements to their city, while receiving predictable, tax-free returns every year, and, at the end of the bond (often 5-10 years), the individual gets his or her money back. They don&#39;t offer the theoretically sky-high returns of stocks, but they do offer tax-efficient returns at very low risk (the default rate on municipal bonds is close to 1 in 1,000). </p>

<p>Municipal bonds should be easy, sleep-at-night investments that allow you to contribute to your community directly. The problem is, they&#39;re not. At this moment in time, buying a municipal bond is complicated and expensive, in the U.S. <a href="http://blog.iriomk.com/post/104125235983/a-melhor-forma-de-nao-investir-em-titulos-publicos">and elsewhere</a>. Those who have wealth and the right broker are buying them, and <a href="http://www.bondbuyer.com/news/washington-taxation/sen-coburn-eliminate-the-muni-tax-exemption-1068624-1.html">benefiting disproportionately</a> because the market is effectively closed to the average person. People are starting to realize that they&#39;re missing out, and when cities do open up their bond issuances, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26272746/denvers-500-mini-bonds-sell-out-first-hour">they sell out fast</a>.</p>

<p>We&#39;re heading towards an inflection point, and I&#39;m certainly not the only one to have realized that. <a href="http://neighbor.ly">Neighbor.ly</a>, which was one of the pioneers in the donation-based civic crowdfunding space, is building a platform to allow individuals and households to invest directly in their cities by buying bonds. So I&#39;ve decided to join the team as Head of Product to help make that happen. I&#39;m taking leave from my research because I think we&#39;re at a critical moment in deciding the future path of community development, and I want to be in the front seat with the <a href="https://neighbor.ly/about">fantastic team</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/luminopolis">Jase</a> has put together. It&#39;s also a fun return to a subject I once spent a lot of time on: my first job out of college was reporting on government bonds and currency markets for Bloomberg News in London. So all that studying of yield curves and ratings scales is coming in very handy once again, a decade later.</p>

<p>From now on, I&#39;ll be writing more about how municipal bonds work (and don&#39;t work), and soon we&#39;ll be giving you the chance to invest directly in your community through Neighborly. Come and join us on this new path.</p>

		Three Provocations for Civic Crowdfunding
		<p><img src="/blog/img/3.png" alt="http://www.fotopedia.com/users/R53-8VoCz0M"></p>

<p>This week I&#39;m in Daegu, Korea, and on Thursday (23rd October) will be giving a talk at the annual <a href="http://ir15.aoir.org/">Association of Internet Researchers conference (AoIR)</a>, titled &quot;Three Provocations for Civic Crowdfunding.&quot; If you&#39;re in Daegu, do stop by the session or find me around the event. If you&#39;re not in Daegu, I&#39;ll update this post with my slides before Thursday.</p>

<p>I&#39;m excited to be part of a panel called &quot;Commodification and Crowdsourcing&quot;, with <a href="http://wishcrys.com/">Crystal Abidin</a>, <a href="http://dbrabham.wordpress.com/">Daren Brabham</a> and <a href="http://www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=608&amp;f_id=35">Andrew Herman</a>. Daren is one of the few other researchers I&#39;ve found who is paying attention to the sociological aspects of crowdfunding, and he&#39;s going to be talking about the impact of crowdfunding discourse on public funding for the arts. </p>

<p>Since AoIR format is short papers, I&#39;ve included the full text below. An extended version will hopefully be appearing in print over the next few months.</p>

<p><em>Three Provocations for Civic Crowdfunding: AoIR 15, Daegu, Korea</em></p>

<p>The rapid rise of crowdfunding in the past five years, most prominently among US-based platforms such as Kickstarter and IndieGoGo, has begun to attract the attention of a wide range of scholars, policymakers and practitioners. As the industry evolves, it is developing a range of specialist sub-genres and platforms, from politics to manufacturing. This paper considers civic crowdfunding – the use of crowdfunding for projects that produce community or quasi-public assets – and argues that its emergence demands a fresh set of questions and approaches.</p>

<p>Scholarly analyses of crowdfunding to date have centered on fields such as investment finance, and Computer-Supported Co-operative Work (CSCW). While these inquiries have begun to build a frameworks for understanding the dynamics of the fundraising process and participants&#39; motivations, there is yet to be substantial work considering the socio-political context and broader implications of crowdfunding. These questions are necessarily more pressing and contested when considering the use of crowdfunding for civic projects. The sub-field of `civic crowdfunding&#39; as an application of the model is yet to be defined by academic researchers. The use of the term can be traced to 2012, and is used by platforms such as Spacehive and Neighbor.ly (Davies 2014a). This paper uses a mixed-methods case study approach to highlight and analyze critical cases in civic crowdfunding. It draws on quantitative analysis of project fundraising data drawn from four platforms (Citizinvestor, IOBY, Neighbo.ly and Spacehive), participant interviews and discourse analysis of projects&#39; promotional material. In so doing it posits three provocations for the future study of civic crowdfunding. </p>

<p>Firstly, to what extent is civic crowdfunding participatory? It can be a truly organic mechanism that is a new tool available to activists. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the graffiti artist Mundano raised $27,000 on the Catarse platform in May 2012 --- twice the campaign&#39;s original target --- to paint the carts of waste pickers, as a means of highlighting their contribution to the city&#39;s environmental sustainability and advocating for new labor protections for them. The idea that crowdfunding is a form of participation as well as a funding mechanism is salient since civic crowdfunding has emerged after a decade of experimentation with symbolic money as a representation of agency through participatory budgeting, most prominently in Brazil and New York City. But most crowdfunding platforms do not support the kind of deliberative process that would be expected in a participatory democratic structure: by the time a campaign is published on a platform, the idea is expected to be fully formed. Furthemore, since donations vary in size and offer differential agencies, the field is open to the charge that it may become dominated by resourced interests. Several of the largest civic crowdfunding campaigns to date have drawn the majority of their funding not from a high volume, low-donation value crowd, but from wealthier donors. For example, Kansas City&#39;s B-Cycle program, partially crowdfunded on Neighbor.ly, drew 99% of its funding from six backers who donated more than $5,000 each.</p>

<p>Secondly, does civic crowdfunding exacerbate or reduce economic inequality? At the case level, there are clear examples of underserved and privileged communities benefiting from civic crowdfunding in very different ways. In Glyn Coch, South Wales, a community with chronic unemployment and resource challenges, local organizers raised $49,000 to fill a gap in funding for a new community center, most of which was funded by government grants. By contrast, in October 2013, three wealthy suburban communities in Oakland, CA, raised $50,000 on the CrowdTilt platform to crowdfund private security patrols. The campaigns, which emerged within a few days of each other, demonstrated the risk of a &#39;contagion effect&#39; through which resourced communities could use civic crowdfunding campaigns from other localities as templates for building their replacement public services. At the platform level there are more ambiguous indicators with respect to equity. New York and Miami-based platform IOBY is the only platform that explicitly recruits projects from underserved communities. Early findings suggest that IOBY projects occur in neighborhoods with slightly higher poverty rates, but the difference is marginal (Goodspeed and Davies 2014). Citizinvestor finds in its own data that there is no correlation between the likelihood of a project occurring in a neighborhood and that neighborhood&#39;s average household income. </p>

<p>Thirdly, does civic crowdfunding support or undermine the role of public institutions? In many cases the link between civic crowdfunding and weakened institutions is direct: The bankrupt city of Central Falls, Rhode Island, crowdfunded $20,000 to pay for recycling facilities in Jenks park in November 2013, explicitly citing its financial distress as a motivating factor. Around one in ten projects in the dataset makes reference to shortfalls in public funding, and Brabham has argued that the success of crowdfunding is likely to be a disincentive for public investment in the arts in the future (Davies 2014b, Brabham 2012). Yet on the other hand, civic crowdfunding can also be framed as a mechanism that expands the range of public-private partnerships that are possible, since government can partner with crowdfunded groups. Parklets, a system of allowing individuals and groups to create temporary installations in parking spaces, is one public-private framework that has benefited from crowdfunding. Eleven parklets have been successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter since April 2012, in Oakland, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Vancouver, raising a total of $100,853. In August 2013, the City of San Francisco launched Living Innovation Zones, a program modeled on parklets that invites proposals for a series of underutilized spaces across the city, and encourages prospective groups to consider crowdfunding. Public-private opportunities that embrace crowdfunding as a potential tool are nascent, but are gaining in popularity.</p>

<p>Each of these three provocations is highly context-specific and as yet the signals from the available data and reported cases are mixed and often conflicting. Nevertheless, they underscore the importance of approaching civic crowdfunding as a socio-politically located and contested phenomenon, and offer pathways for researchers to begin to critically analyze and define the field. Future research work on civic crowdfunding that considers its institutional and political context is likely to be highly generative across disciplines.</p>

		Crowdfunding Cities as Collaborative Innovation
		<p><img src="/blog/img/merge.png" alt="http://www.fotopedia.com/users/R53-8VoCz0M"></p>

<p>Today at the Academy of Management&#39;s Annual Meeting in Philadelphia some colleagues and I will be giving a panel titled <a href="http://program.aom.org/2014/submission.asp?mode=ShowSession&amp;SessionID=1026">Towards Government 2.0: Open Data and Innovation through Cross-Sector Collaboration</a>. We&#39;re going to be talking about open data, building better and more open government services, and how to foster civic collaboration across sectors. </p>

<p>Unfortunately I won&#39;t be at the meeting in person (I&#39;m in the midst of relocating to San Francisco), so I&#39;ve contributed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbnQHKdIwLY">a video</a> in which I talk about some of the work I&#39;ve done on crowdfunding in cities. </p>

<p>I&#39;m interested in how crowdfunding can be a means not just of getting something done (i.e. a funding mechanism), but a means of getting something done in a particular way: collaboratively. </p>

<p>The crowd in a crowdfunding campaign collaborates ambiently – by contributing in the same place, they benefit from mutual awareness and together create a movement that has momentum. But in civic crowdfunding there&#39;s also another layer of possible collaboration, between the crowd and cities, because cities are likely to have an interest in almost any project that provides a service to a local community. That interest could be regulatory (the city regulates the use of a particular kind of space or activity), or it could be participatory (the city wants to know what&#39;s going on and to support good ideas). Those interests could be construed positively or negatively, depending on the relationship between the city and the project participants – the city could be perceived as supportive and welcoming, or heavy-handed and interfering.</p>

<p>Crowdfunding has the potential to help structure those relationships positively, if cities and project owners approach the project in the right way. The substance of my talk, which you can check out below, is to give four suggestions for how cities can frame structure their involvement in civic crowdfunding projects to deliver the best outcomes. You&#39;ll also be able to read more on this in <a href="http://rodrigodavies.com/civiccrowdfunding">an upcoming collection I&#39;m contributing to on Smarter Cities</a>, edited by <a href="http://www.esade.edu/faculty/esteve.almirall">Esteve Almirall</a> and <a href="http://boydcohen.com">Boyd Cohen</a>. </p>

		What's Crowdfunding (and What's Not)
		<p><img src="/blog/img/lonely.png" alt="http://www.fotopedia.com/users/R53-8VoCz0M"></p>

<p>Recently I came across a fundraising campaign by a consortium of non-profits in the US earlier this year to raise money over a short period of time. Participating organizations were ranked in a public ranking, and competed for prizes based on the amount they raised and the number of donors they attracted. A running total of the overall amount donated was published on the site. The effort was fairly successful, and raised close to a million dollars for over 300 organizations. The most successful organization raised over $25,000, although one-fifth of participating organizations raised zero.</p>

<p>The initiative was described to me as being similar to crowdfunding, likely because of its gamified flavor. Although the folks behind it weren&#39;t using the language of crowdfunding, several observers were. But it wasn&#39;t crowdfunding, and there are a number of important reasons why.</p>

<p>Before I get into that, let&#39;s be clear: I&#39;m not making a point about the technical definition of the term <em>crowdfunding</em>. My critique is not that this initiative missed many opportunities to create a compelling campaign that crowdfunders and crowdfunding platforms make use of every day. The following criticisms are not specific to this case, either. They&#39;re common problems among inexperienced (and reluctant) online fundraisers, particularly in the non-profit space. That&#39;s why I&#39;m not going to name the initiative here, instead I&#39;m going to refer to it as Acme Non-Profit Initiative. </p>

<p>Here are the biggest problems I observed.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>There was no crowd</strong>. One of the main distinguishing elements of crowdfunding is the mutual awareness of donors. It&#39;s what reminds us that we&#39;re not acting alone (breaking down &#39;pluralistic ignorance&#39;), and gives us a sense of belonging. Acme Non-Profit Initiative&#39;s website did not show any identifying information about other donors, simply the numbers. It was not, as far as I can tell, able to interface with donors&#39; Facebook and Twitter accounts directly to enable them to see which of their friends had already donated. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>There were no projects</strong>. The prompt for donation was a one paragraph description of the organization, with a selection of links. There was no clear sense of what projects the organizations were raising money for at this particular time, and what stage they were at. It&#39;s not true that crowdfunding can never be used to pay for overhead costs. If these costs are given as part of a project budget, backers won&#39;t flee. Backers understand that it costs money to keep the lights on, but they&#39;re most interested what&#39;s happening in the building. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>There were no targets</strong>. Besides a number of prizes given to the most successful organizations, there was no sense of what the organizations and the crowd should be aiming for. As a result, there were no metrics for success and no sense of achievement, no matter how well the initiative went. Having the courage to set a target and asking the crowd to help you reach it is part of the interaction and engagement that crowdfunding demands. You&#39;re asking the crowd to take a risk with you by backing your project, and in return your organization is taking a risk by putting its goals and ideas out in public.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The donation data wasn&#39;t transparent</strong>. I found that the total fundraising numbers being reported didn&#39;t correspond with the itemized data. I presume that&#39;s because additional funds were raised during the initiative but given directly, instead of through the platforms. That&#39;s not unusual, but it raises red flags with potential donors when organizations provide incomplete data. A simple line that explained that a certain percentage of funds were given directly or in person would be enough. Being loose with the published numbers undermines the credibility of the initiative and doesn&#39;t meet the standards of transparency people rightly associate with crowdfunding. We should continue to demand that. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>As crowdfunding increasingly becomes used as a catch-all term for all kinds of online fundraising, we&#39;re in danger of missing the point. That danger particularly applies to organizations who already fundraise regularly, and may be under the impression that all they need to do to take advantage of crowdfunding is to digitize, verbatim, their existing processes. The history of technological change has taught us time after time that that won&#39;t work. New technologies reshape and restructure processes and organizations, whether they like it or not. And, <a href="http://www.philanthropy.blogspot.com/2014/05/civil-society-is-missing-boat-on-issues.html">as Lucy Bernholz put it recently</a>, we&#39;re foolish to think that non-profits will be any different. </p>

<p>While it&#39;s great to see so many innovative twists on the crowdfunding model emerge, we need to be sure that we&#39;re not calling things crowdfunding that are really not worthy of the term – and then being disappointed when those initiatives don&#39;t deliver the engagement their creators are hoping for. When done correctly, crowdfunding is bold, risky and open, and it demands those same qualities from backers and creators alike. </p>
