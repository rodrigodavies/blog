		Neighborly Introduces ‘Civic Microbonds’ to Benefit San Leandro Schools
		<p><em>(cross-posted from <a href="blog.neighborly.com/news/neighborly-introduces-civic-microbonds">blog.neighborly.com</a>)</em></p>

<p><img class="horizimg" src="/blog/img/san_leandro_high_school_sold.jpg"></p>

<p>At Neighborly we want to make it possible for everyone to invest in their community: to be able to shape the future of their cities by investing in the change they want to see. Last month, we took an exciting first step towards that vision: we sold the first ever Microbonds for a public project, to support the San Leandro Unified School District (SLUSD).</p>

<p>Of course we suspected this opportunity would be popular. Our users regularly highlight education as the issue they care most about, and it was a unique opportunity to be among the first to try a brand new investment product. We’re delighted to have offered early members of the Neighborly community this opportunity, and the feeling was mutual. So far, so awesome.</p>

<p><strong>About San Leandro School District</strong></p>

<p>The San Leandro Unified School District was formed in 1952 and covers about 12.4 square miles in California’s Central Alameda County. An estimated 8,617 students were enrolled for the 2014-2015 school year. The District currently operates 13 schools, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>8 elementary schools</li>
<li>2 middle schools</li>
<li>2 high schools</li>
<li>1 adult school</li>
<li>1 independent study program</li>
</ul>

<p>In recent years, the District has been focusing on improving its facilities to better the lives and educational experience of its students.</p>

<p><strong>What’s Special About This Investment?</strong></p>

<p>Let’s talk about why we think people chose to invest in San Leandro with us – and why we’re so excited about what’s to come.</p>

<p><strong>Transparency</strong>. While California code required us to limit this to our neighbors that met certain legal qualifications, those qualified neighbors found  a clear picture of what they’d be investing in and where their money would go. We deciphered a 150-page document to highlight the impact the funds would make to the school and community. Like anyone selling an investment product, we provided detailed information on the bonds, such as the Official Statement filed by the school district – but we also gave our neighbors much more compelling and digestible content to get them started before they dug into the documentation.</p>

<p><strong>Impact</strong>. We all know that improving our educational system is a critical problem, and it’s central to building the future of our country. Most people rarely have the opportunity to do more than learn about the problem. By offering these Civic Microbonds, we gave people a chance to be part of the solution, helping to shape the lives of students and set them up for brighter futures.</p>

<p><strong>Financial Return</strong>. The Microbonds were a considerable financial opportunity: they pay 2% tax-free interest for one year, without the risks associated with stocks and other more volatile investment vehicles. Taking into account the tax savings, that could be a  return of 3-4% for our neighbors depending on their personal tax situation.¹ In exchange, we asked our Neighbors to commit to investing in San Leandro Schools for one year, since there isn’t an active secondary market for this type of investment. Considering how little savings accounts are paying at the moment, our neighbors realized that this was a way to put money into a tax-free investment and come out ahead. Wealthy people get and remain wealthy because they have access to vehicles like this private offering. Neighborly believes that everyone should be able to invest in their community and share in the upside.</p>

<p><em>(In order to participate in this investment, users needed to qualify as accredited investors resident in the state of California. The 3-4% tax-adjusted return was calculated based on the example of a CA-resident individual earning $200,000.)</em></p>

<p><strong>Access</strong>. For most municipal bond investments, you need to invest $5,000 or more – but we were able to make this investment available at a minimum of $500. That’s a change we believe needs to happen much more widely. Everybody should be able to invest in and improve communities. It’s in our collective best interest, and it’s part of our civic responsibility.</p>

<p><strong>So, how did we make it happen (and why hasn’t it happened before)?</strong></p>

<p>Municipal bonds are investments created by, of and for the people, and should be available to all regardless of income levels or wealth, but making these Microbonds available at $500 wasn’t as easy as it should have been. Not even close.</p>

<p>The municipal bond industry follows the convention of asking people to invest at least $5,000, which restricts access for many people. It’s not a rule or regulation, but it’s a convention that this is how bond deals are done. Unfortunately it’s a convention that both causes and reflects the fact that the industry has excluded regular people in favor of the wealthy. We jumped through numerous legal hoops to make these Microbonds available at $500. We bought the San Leandro bonds, created a single-use LLC to own them, and sold shares in that company priced at $500 each. In this way we were able to divide an existing bond into smaller pieces, and make those Microbonds available under regulation 25102(f) of the California code. It was an experiment to show what small-scale retail investing in municipal bond projects could look like.</p>

<p>Bond funds have pooled small-scale investments into larger ones for decades. The difference with a Microbond is that instead of simply investing in a generic area such as ‘California municipal bonds’ with no clear sense of where your money is going, Microbonds enable investors to participate in specific municipal bonds that match the type of infrastructure project they would like to support (in this case a school district) and the locality of their choosing (San Leandro). We believe that restoring the connection between the investor and the recipient of their investment is a significant step forward in improving how communities are financed.</p>

<p>It shouldn’t be this way, and we’re hoping to sound a wake up call to the public finance industry: investment opportunities should be open to everyone.</p>

<p>Lowering the denomination will open the benefits of  community investment to a much wider range of people. In a digital age of public investment, the excuse that lower denominations and greater numbers of investors leads to ‘more paperwork’ doesn’t wash. We look forward to the day when investing in your community is as easy as buying a stock. We’re excited to work with the many folks in the industry who want to get to that day soon.</p>

<p><strong>This Is What We Do Best, and What’s Ahead of Us</strong></p>

<p>We’re thrilled to have offered our neighbors an opportunity to invest in something as important as education. Thank you to those of you who participated. To you, and those of you who didn’t invest this time, Neighborly will be curating a range of investment opportunities in the months ahead. They will all help us to build better neighborhoods and communities. To learn more about similar opportunities in your area, join Neighborly and explore opportunities to invest in your community.</p>

<p>The best part? This is only the beginning. We’re putting a new spin on civic finance, and this deal is the first of many you’ll see on Neighborly in the coming months. And because you’re getting involved now, you’ll have a chance to take advantage of similar opportunities as soon as they appear. Lead the crowd instead of getting beaten by it, right?</p>

		A New Crowd for Old Problems – How You Can Start Impact Investing Locally
		<p>Earlier this week I gave a talk at <a href="http://pacscenter.stanford.edu">Stanford&#39;s Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society</a>, publishers of the <a href="http://ssireview.org">Stanford Social Innovation Review</a>, on civic crowdfunding. I was excited to share how my research into crowd-based community finance has evolved, and how <a href="http://neighborly.com">Neighborly</a>&#39;s launch this summer will make impact investing a local reality for the first time in the US. Here&#39;s the talk.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bofDUZy5whA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Here&#39;s the transcript of the video above.</p>

<p>Hey I’m Rodrigo. I’m an on leave PhD candidate here at Stanford in Management Science and Engineering. The reason I’m on leave is that i’m currently head of product at Neighborly, a community investing marketplace. I&#39;m going to talk more about that later. </p>

<p>Now some friends have sent me various pieces of internet history that suggests I was, along with my former advisor Ethan Zuckerman, responsible for popularizing the term &#39;civic crowdfunding’ and definition. So you can blame me if you don&#39;t like it. </p>

<p>So I&#39;m going to start with the story of why I came to care about this topic in the first place.</p>

<p>Back in 2011, I got interested in the idea that technologically-supported crowds could overcome problems that offline communities have in accessing and building services and infrastructure that they need. The digital version of what Elinor Ostrom called public entrepreneurship.</p>

<p>I was in Mumbai at the time, helping to launch Conde Nast’s digital business in India. Mumbai is place with significant infrastructural challenges, and many separate examples of community-based cooperation. I saw some of the earliest examples of young middle-class Indians reimagining the cities in which they lived, through art, fashion and especially technology. They weren&#39;t about to remake India&#39;s physical infrastructure, but they were creating their own social infrastructure. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, late in 2011, I heard about the story of the town of Glyncoch in South Wales, a mining community about 20 miles west of where I grew up, in Newport. A group there was trying to build a new community center. The existing one, a 1970s creation, was falling apart, despite its popularity.</p>

<p>The South Wales valley region is in some ways the UK&#39;s Detroit – once dependent on a single industry, coal mining, its economic fortunes haven&#39;t recovered since the 1980s, when the industry’s decline began.</p>

<p>So the Glyn Coch community needed to raise $1.2 million for the project, and they were $40,000 short. It may sound like a small gap, but it was enough to put the whole project in jeopardy. At that point, with not too many options left, the community was put in touch with Spacehive, a 4-person startup trying to apply the donation-based crowdfunding model popularized by Kickstarter to civic projects.</p>

<p>No one in the Glyncoch group had heard of Kickstarter. Nevertheless, the community took a chance on the new idea of crowdfunding. They listed their project on Spacehive.</p>

<p>Amazingly, in five weeks, the Glyn Coch group raised the money and the project went ahead. This is the center in 2014. To me this was a striking example of how to reimagine civic engagement and empower communities to marshal the resources they need, even in the most challenging circumstances. </p>

<p>I was so inspired by Glyn Coch that in 2012, I decided to work pro-bono with Spacehive, collaborating with community groups, council leaders and members of parliament, such Green Party MP and former leader Caroline Lucas. She was one of many politicians excited about the idea. And what I saw was many public agencies and communities connecting for the first time to talk about how to build better towns and cities. Everyone around the table was struggling with financial constraints, but the chance to cooperate opened up new possibilities to get things done. </p>

<p>My time at Spacehive was cut short only because I had agreed to take up a place in a masters&#39; program at MIT&#39;s Center for Civic Media. </p>

<p>And I decided to spend the next two years looking at this emerging trend of technologically-supported crowds funding public goods. By the time I got to Cambridge, a range of platforms like Spacehive had sprung up in the US, Spain, Brazil and Finland.</p>

<p>At this point, I didn&#39;t meet with universal approval from professors. For a start, the term civic crowdfunding didn&#39;t exist. But I believed that what I had seen at Spacehive was emergent and powerful. So I ignored most of the advice and carried on. Luckily for me, by the time I&#39;d finished in 2014, civic crowdfunding was a term that people were starting to recognize.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m going to save you the time of reading 173 pages, and tell you what I learned in those two years, because I think it&#39;s at best the first half of the story.</p>

<p>I assembled a dataset of 1,224 projects launched between 2010 and 2014. Within that dataset I found some startling trends. </p>

<p>First, Most people want to donate about $60. </p>

<p>Most projects are small scale, less than $20,000. </p>

<p>Most projects happen in dense urban areas – especially those with high concentrations of college-educated 25-35 year olds.</p>

<p>The most common kind of project is a park or a garden.</p>

<p>I also ran into some complex ethical and political questions. Will Civic Crowdfunding deter investment in the long term? Will richer communities benefit more? Unfortunately it’s still too early to know if these are questions, or real problems.</p>

<p>So I came to the conclusion that while donation-based crowdfunding of public goods has benefited a lot of communities already, it raises some tough questions around scale and ethics. It&#39;s great at solving small-scale, uncontroversial issues - because who doesn&#39;t love a park - but it hasn’t yet proven it can solve, big, hard problems. </p>

<p>So where do we go from here?</p>

<p>I started to look at the incumbent mechanisms of financing public goods. Tax dollars, municipal budgets, and what to me was the elephant in the room – municipal bonds.</p>

<p>Now perhaps it didn&#39;t take me so long to get to muni bonds because between 2004 and 2006, I was reporting on the bond markets at Bloomberg News in london. This was the time when we were just starting to wake up to what goes wrong when people stop understanding how debt markets should work.</p>

<p>Are you familiar with how US cities and public agencies finance themselves using the bond market? </p>

<p>Well, I&#39;ll give you an overview. Public agencies raise $1bn a day for everything from school improvements to transport infrastructure. The New York Canals were funded by bonds. The Golden Gate Bridge was funded by bonds. In a bond deal, a city gets a loan, promises to pay a fixed interest-rate and in theory, any one of us can invest. It should be a fantastic, open way to produce public goods.</p>

<p>But bonds today are a very Wall Street kind of thing. Call a broker and get in line. If you&#39;re a high-rolling client you might just get a piece of the action. In fact the two are so intertwined that back in January, Texas Public Schools had to pause closing an investment deal because of storms in New York. True story.</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t always used to be that way. Half a century ago, public officials used to stand on the courthouse steps to sell bonds for public projects. They called on the crowd to pitch in, and the crowd were repaid for their efforts.</p>

<p>So what if we could connect the excitement and energy generated by donation-based crowdfunding to the much bigger, older problem of how to provide infrastructure? And in the process, reconnect people to their cities?</p>

<p>Now unknown to me, Neighborly, one of the donation-based platforms I studied while at MIT, had actually started out planning to help reform the muni bond market. But back in Neighborly they found investors were not as enthusiastic about disrupting the financial services industry as they are now, and the team was unable to raise funding for the idea. So Neighborly decided to get started with the donation crowdfunding model, which was better understood. In two years Neighborly raised $2.5 million for donation-based crowdfunding projects. Of course the team found exactly what I had – that donation-based crowdfunding matches small needs much better than large ones. So after two years of proving the crowd could be marshaled for civic purposes, their founder Jase Wilson returned to the idea of opening up public finance on a bigger scale. When Jase told me about their plans, it was obvious to me that I needed to be involved.</p>

<p>We agreed that because tax-free municipal bonds are a great investment as well as a civic good, they can go much, much further in improving cities. Retail investors buy more municipal bonds every week than Kickstarter has raised in its 6 year history. The main challenge is getting those bonds out of the hands of brokers and into the hands of those households.</p>

<p>In a couple of months, we&#39;re going to be opening the first truly accessible investments in US cities. Our goal is to give more people than ever before the chance to both contribute to and benefit from investment in public goods, and to break down layers of markets that depend on flipping to make a profit at every stage.</p>

<p>To me, this is very much the spirit of civic crowdfunding. It&#39;s not limited to a donation-based campaigns. It&#39;s the opening up of inaccessible financial processes to involve everyone.</p>

<p>What&#39;s really gratifying for me personally is that we&#39;re already hearing that we&#39;re not the only ones who have been through this thought process around earlier models of crowdfunding. </p>

<p>When we asked some of our users the question, why did you sign up for Neighborly, one wrote:
&quot;Do something better with my money than funding another piece of lame technology on Kickstarter.&quot;</p>

<p>So I&#39;d like to leave you with the thought that as we sit here thinking about the future of funding cities, we need to consider all of the tools we have in our armory. Old and new.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve passed through the first phase of trying to connect this idea to public goods and cities. I think the next phase calls on us to think bigger and bolder. I&#39;m really excited to have today&#39;s conversation with you and to hear more about what you&#39;re working on.</p>

<p>Thank you for listening, and I look forward to continuing the conversation. </p>

		Is Airbnb a civic tech company, a peace tech company, or neither?
		<p><img src="/blog/img/airbnb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In the past two weeks, I&#39;ve been to two events at which a speaker suggested Airbnb is a de facto social impact technology company. </p>

<p>On April 14, former DC mayor <a href="http://twitter.com/amfenty">Adrian Fenty</a> included Airbnb in a map of civic technology companies that <a href="http://a16z.com">Andreessen Horowitz</a> (whom he advises) has invested in in a presentation at Civic Hall in New York. Eleven days later, in Nicosia, Cyprus, <a href="http://twitter.com/mark__nelson">Mark Nelson of the Stanford Peace Innovation Lab</a> suggested in a <a href="http://howtobuildpeace.org">Build Peace</a> panel that Airbnb was the largest peace technology company in the world, because it enables users to stay in the homes of strangers from other cultures (Full disclosure: I am a co-director of <a href="http://howtobuildup.org">Build Up</a>, which organizes Build Peace).</p>

<p>Adrian and Mark&#39;s comments were divisive in two strikingly similar ways.</p>

<p>First, some people felt the comparison was lazy, and risked diluting their field&#39;s identity.</p>

<p>In some ways I empathize with this point of view. It&#39;s possible, but unproven that Airbnb&#39;s success has led to greater cross-cultural and cross-racial contact, and therefore has promoted peaceful international relations. On the other hand, use of the platform could replicate existing cultural ties or encourage homophily, a trend that <a href="http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/rewire-digital-cosmopolitans-in-the-age-of-connection">Ethan Zuckerman has observed among many online communities</a>. Are white hosts are more likely to receive white guests than those of other races, or is the opposite true? I don&#39;t know the answer, and can&#39;t form an opinion on racial and cultural interaction on Airbnb without looking at the data. We should ask questions and seek data before lionizing Airbnb for something to which even the company itself does not lay claim. Similarly, we should decide on indicators of the civic role that Airbnb might play before giving the platform another unasked-for label. We might ask a question like &quot;Are Airbnb guests more likely to talk positively about their host city as a result of using the platform than hotel guests?&quot; Civic technologists and peacebuilders could learn a lot from a dataset as rich as Airbnb&#39;s by asking hard questions that are core to those fields. Doing so will put all of us in a stronger position to make provocative claims without being accused of losing sight of a field&#39;s identity and mission.</p>

<p>Second, some were irritated by what they perceived as an attempt to steer their field towards for-profit business models at the expense of work for which the ROI is much harder to quantify.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t get into the complexity of measuring impact and ROI and impact in civic and peacebuilding projects here (that&#39;s a vast subject), but I think almost everyone can acknowledge that not all civic and peacebuilding projects are capable of being for-profit enterprises. Neither do I think that either Adrian or Mark was suggesting that all projects should be structured as for-profit businesses. Rather, I take from their comments two important observations: first, that there is a lot that civic and peace tech companies can learn from the success of private sector tech startups, and second, that in many cases outcomes like peace and civic engagement are secondary outcomes that result from improving people&#39;s quality of life, and that those improvements are the space in which we should be spending much more of our time. There are plenty of folks in civic and peace tech who should be paying attention to these observations, and who are evidently not doing so.</p>

<p><strong>Are you learning?</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with what civic and peace tech companies can learn from startups. Ideas that are considered necessary for survival as a private sector tech startup are often absent from civic and peace tech projects. Authentic <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design">user-centered design</a> is hard to do when your organization or sponsor is a vast bureaucracy with a hierarchical culture. <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org">Agile software development</a> is almost impossible when you have an RFP process that looks like it was written by the 19th century British civil service. Civic tech is making great progress in changing culture and process from within and outside bureaucracies, thanks to awesome organizations like <a href="http://18f.gsa.gov">18F</a>, <a href="http://codeforamerica.org">Code for America</a> and the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service">US Digital Service</a>. Peace tech seems to be having a much harder time modernizing. That&#39;s not wholly surprising, since peacebuilding has been around for longer, and hierarchical, bureacratic culture permeates down from large institutions to smaller organizations as a result of funding relationships. That dynamic is less common in civic tech because government funding of civic tech is a pretty recent phenomenon. There are of course some peacebuilding organizations, large and small, that are embracing flexible, modern ways of working, but making this transition is difficult. Done right, these methods challenge conventional organizational structures. But the results in technology projects speak for themselves.</p>

<p>The modernizers in civic and peace tech aren&#39;t all for-profit organizations – they&#39;re picking the best methods that have been proven in the for-profit sector and adapting them to their mission. If you&#39;re building a piece of software, you need a robust product development paradigm whether or not that application users are sharing photos, participating in conflict resolution, or contributing to their community. Following the practices the for-profit sector takes for granted will also give you a much wider selection of talent to work with, instead of being restricted to the pool of contractors who have spent more time learning the art of government / development procurement jujitsu than the job you&#39;re hiring them for. Guess what? That probably means lower costs.</p>

<p><strong>Let the problem serve the mission</strong></p>

<p>Now, what about the assumption that peace or civic engagement should be the primary objective of a peace or civic tech company? Is Airbnb excluded from being a civic or peace tech company because its primary mission is neither civic engagement nor peace? I don&#39;t think so. At <a href="http://neighborly.com">Neighborly</a>, we&#39;re passionate about civic engagement, reconnecting people and cities and helping to build better public infrastructure. But we&#39;re not building a civic engagement platform. <a href="http://neighborly.com/how-it-works">We&#39;re building a community investment marketplace to allow people to invest in their city through municipal bonds</a>. Our goal is to bring low-risk tax-free investment opportunities that are currently dominated by the wealthy to everyone, and to drastically reduce the amount that cities pay to finance infrastructure by giving them an alternative to the manifold gatekeepers and middlemen they currently have to work with. We believe that solving those two problems will increase civic engagement and make cities more resilient in the long run.</p>

<p>I believe that&#39;s the way it should be for any civic or peace tech company. Start with the problem you&#39;re addressing, not your desire to deliver a more peaceful world or a more civically engaged population. You can&#39;t solve peace or civic engagement because neither is a single problem. They&#39;re both, quite obviously, made up of thousands of interconnected problems. If you pick one of those problems and you do your job well, you&#39;ll be doing the best you can to help create a more peaceful and engaged world. You&#39;ll be a peace tech company or a civic tech company, and not just because that&#39;s a label you apply to your work. Don&#39;t be another civic engagement platform or peacebuilding platform solution in search of a problem.</p>

<p>So is Airbnb a civic or a peace tech company? It didn&#39;t set out to solve a civic or peace-related problem, but it may be doing so. We shouldn&#39;t rule out that possibility. We should just ask better questions. If Airbnb isn&#39;t increasing civic engagement and/or promoting peace but you believe it could, offer to partner and help the company realize its potential. On the other hand, if Airbnb is leading to a more civically engaged, peaceful world, ask yourself what their team is doing that your organization is not. </p>

		A New Way to Invest in Communities
		<p><img src="/blog/img/ggb.png" alt=""></p>

<p>For the past couple of years I&#39;ve been thinking about how to bring the energy, potential and ambition of donation/reward crowdfunding to community development and civic engagement. I was lucky to be an early employee of <a href="http://www.spacehive.com">Spacehive</a>, one of the first movers in the space, I put together the first <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2434615">study of the field</a> (with the help of <a href="http://civiccrowdfunding.com">Ethan</a> and others at MIT), and I got to watch as the idea of civic crowdfunding caught the attention of the media, researchers, and finally, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-hails-the-rise-of-civic-crowdfunding">heads of state</a>. I got to watch some incredible people <a href="http://spacehive.com/glyncochcc">make change for their neighborhoods</a> and <a href="http://catarse.me/pt/pimpmycarroca">their communities</a>.</p>

<p>But there were two questions that often gave me pause. First, should we be funding civic projects through philanthropy, and does the success of that undermine public investment? Second, is it realistic to expect philanthropic crowds to raise the large sums that are often necessary to improve a community&#39;s quality of life? </p>

<p>The first question is a judgement call for which I&#39;ve seen persuasive arguments on both sides. On the second question, I&#39;ve seen very few cases that persuade me that the answer is yes. That&#39;s not to say donation/reward civic crowdfunding doesn&#39;t have a bright future in some respects. It has proven itself to be a robust way to produce small-scale change, especially in urban communities. As I&#39;ve argued many times before, if non-profits start to take donation/reward crowdfunding seriously as a tactic, it has the potential to transform that sector and energize a whole new generation of small-dollar philanthropists. I will continue to work with and advise organizations who are considering donation-based civic crowdfunding for the right projects.</p>

<p>However, there are other methods of financing community development that can give a much stronger &#39;yes&#39; to that second question, the question of scale. One of those is a very old form of crowd-based finance: municipal bonds. For just over two centuries, U.S. cities have been using them to finance critical improvements, from transport infrastructure, to schools, to the <a href="http://goldengatebridge.org/research/BondMeasure.php">Golden Gate Bridge</a>. Municipal bonds give individuals the opportunity to invest in improvements to their city, while receiving predictable, tax-free returns every year, and, at the end of the bond (often 5-10 years), the individual gets his or her money back. They don&#39;t offer the theoretically sky-high returns of stocks, but they do offer tax-efficient returns at very low risk (the default rate on municipal bonds is close to 1 in 1,000). </p>

<p>Municipal bonds should be easy, sleep-at-night investments that allow you to contribute to your community directly. The problem is, they&#39;re not. At this moment in time, buying a municipal bond is complicated and expensive, in the U.S. <a href="http://blog.iriomk.com/post/104125235983/a-melhor-forma-de-nao-investir-em-titulos-publicos">and elsewhere</a>. Those who have wealth and the right broker are buying them, and <a href="http://www.bondbuyer.com/news/washington-taxation/sen-coburn-eliminate-the-muni-tax-exemption-1068624-1.html">benefiting disproportionately</a> because the market is effectively closed to the average person. People are starting to realize that they&#39;re missing out, and when cities do open up their bond issuances, <a href="http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26272746/denvers-500-mini-bonds-sell-out-first-hour">they sell out fast</a>.</p>

<p>We&#39;re heading towards an inflection point, and I&#39;m certainly not the only one to have realized that. <a href="https://neighborly.com">Neighborly</a>, which was one of the pioneers in the donation-based civic crowdfunding space, is building a platform to allow individuals and households to invest directly in their cities by buying bonds. So I&#39;ve decided to join the team as Head of Product to help make that happen. I&#39;m taking leave from my research because I think we&#39;re at a critical moment in deciding the future path of community development, and I want to be in the front seat with the <a href="https://neighbor.ly/about">fantastic team</a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/luminopolis">Jase</a> has put together. It&#39;s also a fun return to a subject I once spent a lot of time on: my first job out of college was reporting on government bonds and currency markets for Bloomberg News in London. So all that studying of yield curves and ratings scales is coming in very handy once again, a decade later.</p>

<p>From now on, I&#39;ll be writing more about how municipal bonds work (and don&#39;t work), and soon we&#39;ll be giving you the chance to invest directly in your community through Neighborly. Come and join us on this new path.</p>
