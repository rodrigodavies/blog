<h2>Introducing the Creative Industries Prototyping Lab</h2>
<p class="meta">14 Mar 2014</p>

	<p><img src="/blog/img/cipl.png" alt="">
Do you know innovators in Latin America? Next month in Lima, Peru, I&#39;ll be co-hosting a three-day workshop for entrepreneurs in the creative industries, focused on design thinking, product development and fundraising.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an exciting project called <a href="http://yolab.us/cipl">Creative Industries Prototyping Lab</a>, and applications to attend the workshop are open now. We&#39;re looking for entrepreneurs who already have the germ of a product or service idea, but are looking to refine their thinking and learn more about how to bring it to market. </p>

<p>Is that you? <a href="http://yolab.us/cipl">Get in touch now</a>. </p>

<p>My five collaborators, <a href="http://marisca.pe/en/">Eduardo</a>, <a href="http://ericadeahl.com">Erica</a>, <a href="http://jasonlipshin.net">Jason</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/julie-fischer/b/328/a7a">Julie</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/lingyuxiu-zhong/26/433/982">Ling</a> and I are interdisciplinary folks drawn from disciplines such as interactive design, research, UX, video games and educational technology, but one of the areas I&#39;m most excited to talk about is alternative fundraising strategies. As regular readers of this blog know, I&#39;ve written often about the <a href="/blog/2013/09/16/how-to-crowdfund-a-million-dollar-arts-project.html">risks associated with crowdfunding</a>, success rates and ways that entrepreneurs are <a href="/blog/2013/10/17/crowdfunding-as-a-salary-or-crowdfunding-from-your-salary.html">trying to turn ad-hoc fundraising into a sustainable income stream</a>. Entrepreneurs in emerging creative industries need to be aware of these issues and possible approaches as they navigate the best way to bring a product to market. </p>

<p>Over the course of the three days we&#39;ll be holding a series of collaborative and interdisciplinary lectures, workshops and design sessions that lead participants through the potentials and challenges of working in the digital creative industries, and work through a process of critical technology design. Our goal is to produce prototypes of tools, media and processes that allow groups and communities to share creative visions â€“ and to help participants develop the knowledge and skills they need to build audiences, manage community interactions, make an impact on social issues, and develop sustainable creative ventures.</p>

<p>CIPL will culminate in a public showcase ahead of the <a href="http://hastac2014.org">HASTAC conference</a>, where you&#39;ll also find several of us giving presentations and papers related to our independent projects. Hope to see you there! </p>
