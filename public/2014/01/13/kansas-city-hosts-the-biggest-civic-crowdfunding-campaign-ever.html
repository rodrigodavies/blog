<h2>Kansas City Hosts The Biggest Civic Crowdfunding Campaign Ever</h2>
<p class="meta">13 Jan 2014</p>

	<p><strong>Update: there&#39;s <a href="http://nextcity.org/sharedcity/entry/kansas-city-tries-crowdfunding-its-bike-share">a great piece in Next City</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/nancyscola">Nancy Scola</a> citing this post.</strong></p>

<p>Today the Kansas City-based non-profit BikeWalkKC launched the biggest civic crowdfunding campaign ever, to extend <a href="http://bikesharekc.com/">the bikeshare scheme</a> the group partially crowdfunded in 2012. </p>

<p>They&#39;re running <a href="http://neighborly.com">ten $100,000 campaigns for the next 46 days on on Neighborly</a> (also based in KC), one for each of the ten zones of the city in which they&#39;re planning to build new stations. The total ask of $1M is, as far as I&#39;m aware, the largest civic project on a crowdfunding platform to date. </p>

<p><img src="/blog/img/bcycle.png" class="horizimg"></p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge task, but the campaign has already raised $300,000 in matching funds: $200,000 from the Federal Highway Administration and $50,000 each from two Kansas City-based organizations, the Kaufman Foundation and the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art. BikeWalkKC will continue to try and raise more big-dollar donations as the campaign progresses. If BikeWalkKC are successful they&#39;ll be able to install an additional 15 bike stations, taking the total in the city to 27.</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently in Kansas City studying the first BikeWalkKC campaign and working on a guide to best practices for non-profits in civic crowdfunding, and it&#39;s exciting to get a front-row seat on this one. BikeWalkKC were already on my radar thanks to <a href="https://donate.neighbor.ly/projects/bikesharekc">their 2012 campaign, which raised a total of $419,298</a>. On that occasion most of the funding came from a single large donor, while $123,940 was raised via Neighbor.ly. </p>

<p>Given the even bigger ask this time, it&#39;s a smart move to modularize the campaign by zone since residents and businesses in those areas have a direct link to the service they&#39;re being asked to support. There&#39;s also the possibility of friendly competition between neighborhoods - and perhaps even their local representatives, if council members back the campaign.</p>

<p>The organization has been <a href="http://bikewalkkc.org/files/bikewalkkc2011annualreport.pdf">advocating for a more walkable city since 2011</a> and in 2012, after finalizing the plans for the bikeshare scheme were announced and securing the first round of funding secured, the group won a proclamation from the city council to <a href="http://bikewalkkc.org/node/234">provide bike lanes for the first time</a> and to support the fledgling bikeshare infrastructure. Without BikeWalkKC&#39;s campaign -- and especially the installation of the bikeshare scheme -- it seems unlikely these biking improvements would have gained sufficient political traction. </p>

<p>With the second round of the campaign aiming even higher - for the magic million figure - it&#39;s a major test case for whether civic crowdfunding can scale. </p>
