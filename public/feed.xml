                                <title>Neighborly Introduces ‘Civic Microbonds’ to Benefit San Leandro Schools</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(cross-posted from &lt;a href=&quot;blog.neighborly.com/news/neighborly-introduces-civic-microbonds&quot;&gt;blog.neighborly.com&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;horizimg&quot; src=&quot;/blog/img/san_leandro_high_school_sold.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At Neighborly we want to make it possible for everyone to invest in their community: to be able to shape the future of their cities by investing in the change they want to see. Last month, we took an exciting first step towards that vision: we sold the first ever Microbonds for a public project, to support the San Leandro Unified School District (SLUSD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course we suspected this opportunity would be popular. Our users regularly highlight education as the issue they care most about, and it was a unique opportunity to be among the first to try a brand new investment product. We’re delighted to have offered early members of the Neighborly community this opportunity, and the feeling was mutual. So far, so awesome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About San Leandro School District&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The San Leandro Unified School District was formed in 1952 and covers about 12.4 square miles in California’s Central Alameda County. An estimated 8,617 students were enrolled for the 2014-2015 school year. The District currently operates 13 schools, including:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;8 elementary schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 middle schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 high schools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 adult school&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 independent study program&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the District has been focusing on improving its facilities to better the lives and educational experience of its students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s Special About This Investment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about why we think people chose to invest in San Leandro with us – and why we’re so excited about what’s to come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transparency&lt;/strong&gt;. While California code required us to limit this to our neighbors that met certain legal qualifications, those qualified neighbors found  a clear picture of what they’d be investing in and where their money would go. We deciphered a 150-page document to highlight the impact the funds would make to the school and community. Like anyone selling an investment product, we provided detailed information on the bonds, such as the Official Statement filed by the school district – but we also gave our neighbors much more compelling and digestible content to get them started before they dug into the documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact&lt;/strong&gt;. We all know that improving our educational system is a critical problem, and it’s central to building the future of our country. Most people rarely have the opportunity to do more than learn about the problem. By offering these Civic Microbonds, we gave people a chance to be part of the solution, helping to shape the lives of students and set them up for brighter futures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial Return&lt;/strong&gt;. The Microbonds were a considerable financial opportunity: they pay 2% tax-free interest for one year, without the risks associated with stocks and other more volatile investment vehicles. Taking into account the tax savings, that could be a  return of 3-4% for our neighbors depending on their personal tax situation.¹ In exchange, we asked our Neighbors to commit to investing in San Leandro Schools for one year, since there isn’t an active secondary market for this type of investment. Considering how little savings accounts are paying at the moment, our neighbors realized that this was a way to put money into a tax-free investment and come out ahead. Wealthy people get and remain wealthy because they have access to vehicles like this private offering. Neighborly believes that everyone should be able to invest in their community and share in the upside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(In order to participate in this investment, users needed to qualify as accredited investors resident in the state of California. The 3-4% tax-adjusted return was calculated based on the example of a CA-resident individual earning $200,000.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access&lt;/strong&gt;. For most municipal bond investments, you need to invest $5,000 or more – but we were able to make this investment available at a minimum of $500. That’s a change we believe needs to happen much more widely. Everybody should be able to invest in and improve communities. It’s in our collective best interest, and it’s part of our civic responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, how did we make it happen (and why hasn’t it happened before)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Municipal bonds are investments created by, of and for the people, and should be available to all regardless of income levels or wealth, but making these Microbonds available at $500 wasn’t as easy as it should have been. Not even close.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The municipal bond industry follows the convention of asking people to invest at least $5,000, which restricts access for many people. It’s not a rule or regulation, but it’s a convention that this is how bond deals are done. Unfortunately it’s a convention that both causes and reflects the fact that the industry has excluded regular people in favor of the wealthy. We jumped through numerous legal hoops to make these Microbonds available at $500. We bought the San Leandro bonds, created a single-use LLC to own them, and sold shares in that company priced at $500 each. In this way we were able to divide an existing bond into smaller pieces, and make those Microbonds available under regulation 25102(f) of the California code. It was an experiment to show what small-scale retail investing in municipal bond projects could look like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bond funds have pooled small-scale investments into larger ones for decades. The difference with a Microbond is that instead of simply investing in a generic area such as ‘California municipal bonds’ with no clear sense of where your money is going, Microbonds enable investors to participate in specific municipal bonds that match the type of infrastructure project they would like to support (in this case a school district) and the locality of their choosing (San Leandro). We believe that restoring the connection between the investor and the recipient of their investment is a significant step forward in improving how communities are financed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t be this way, and we’re hoping to sound a wake up call to the public finance industry: investment opportunities should be open to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowering the denomination will open the benefits of  community investment to a much wider range of people. In a digital age of public investment, the excuse that lower denominations and greater numbers of investors leads to ‘more paperwork’ doesn’t wash. We look forward to the day when investing in your community is as easy as buying a stock. We’re excited to work with the many folks in the industry who want to get to that day soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Is What We Do Best, and What’s Ahead of Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re thrilled to have offered our neighbors an opportunity to invest in something as important as education. Thank you to those of you who participated. To you, and those of you who didn’t invest this time, Neighborly will be curating a range of investment opportunities in the months ahead. They will all help us to build better neighborhoods and communities. To learn more about similar opportunities in your area, join Neighborly and explore opportunities to invest in your community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part? This is only the beginning. We’re putting a new spin on civic finance, and this deal is the first of many you’ll see on Neighborly in the coming months. And because you’re getting involved now, you’ll have a chance to take advantage of similar opportunities as soon as they appear. Lead the crowd instead of getting beaten by it, right?&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>A New Crowd for Old Problems – How You Can Start Impact Investing Locally</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week I gave a talk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://pacscenter.stanford.edu&quot;&gt;Stanford&amp;#39;s Center for Philanthropy and Civil Society&lt;/a&gt;, publishers of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ssireview.org&quot;&gt;Stanford Social Innovation Review&lt;/a&gt;, on civic crowdfunding. I was excited to share how my research into crowd-based community finance has evolved, and how &lt;a href=&quot;http://neighborly.com&quot;&gt;Neighborly&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s launch this summer will make impact investing a local reality for the first time in the US. Here&amp;#39;s the talk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/bofDUZy5whA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the transcript of the video above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey I’m Rodrigo. I’m an on leave PhD candidate here at Stanford in Management Science and Engineering. The reason I’m on leave is that i’m currently head of product at Neighborly, a community investing marketplace. I&amp;#39;m going to talk more about that later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now some friends have sent me various pieces of internet history that suggests I was, along with my former advisor Ethan Zuckerman, responsible for popularizing the term &amp;#39;civic crowdfunding’ and definition. So you can blame me if you don&amp;#39;t like it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m going to start with the story of why I came to care about this topic in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in 2011, I got interested in the idea that technologically-supported crowds could overcome problems that offline communities have in accessing and building services and infrastructure that they need. The digital version of what Elinor Ostrom called public entrepreneurship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was in Mumbai at the time, helping to launch Conde Nast’s digital business in India. Mumbai is place with significant infrastructural challenges, and many separate examples of community-based cooperation. I saw some of the earliest examples of young middle-class Indians reimagining the cities in which they lived, through art, fashion and especially technology. They weren&amp;#39;t about to remake India&amp;#39;s physical infrastructure, but they were creating their own social infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, late in 2011, I heard about the story of the town of Glyncoch in South Wales, a mining community about 20 miles west of where I grew up, in Newport. A group there was trying to build a new community center. The existing one, a 1970s creation, was falling apart, despite its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Wales valley region is in some ways the UK&amp;#39;s Detroit – once dependent on a single industry, coal mining, its economic fortunes haven&amp;#39;t recovered since the 1980s, when the industry’s decline began.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the Glyn Coch community needed to raise $1.2 million for the project, and they were $40,000 short. It may sound like a small gap, but it was enough to put the whole project in jeopardy. At that point, with not too many options left, the community was put in touch with Spacehive, a 4-person startup trying to apply the donation-based crowdfunding model popularized by Kickstarter to civic projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one in the Glyncoch group had heard of Kickstarter. Nevertheless, the community took a chance on the new idea of crowdfunding. They listed their project on Spacehive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazingly, in five weeks, the Glyn Coch group raised the money and the project went ahead. This is the center in 2014. To me this was a striking example of how to reimagine civic engagement and empower communities to marshal the resources they need, even in the most challenging circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was so inspired by Glyn Coch that in 2012, I decided to work pro-bono with Spacehive, collaborating with community groups, council leaders and members of parliament, such Green Party MP and former leader Caroline Lucas. She was one of many politicians excited about the idea. And what I saw was many public agencies and communities connecting for the first time to talk about how to build better towns and cities. Everyone around the table was struggling with financial constraints, but the chance to cooperate opened up new possibilities to get things done. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My time at Spacehive was cut short only because I had agreed to take up a place in a masters&amp;#39; program at MIT&amp;#39;s Center for Civic Media. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And I decided to spend the next two years looking at this emerging trend of technologically-supported crowds funding public goods. By the time I got to Cambridge, a range of platforms like Spacehive had sprung up in the US, Spain, Brazil and Finland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, I didn&amp;#39;t meet with universal approval from professors. For a start, the term civic crowdfunding didn&amp;#39;t exist. But I believed that what I had seen at Spacehive was emergent and powerful. So I ignored most of the advice and carried on. Luckily for me, by the time I&amp;#39;d finished in 2014, civic crowdfunding was a term that people were starting to recognize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;m going to save you the time of reading 173 pages, and tell you what I learned in those two years, because I think it&amp;#39;s at best the first half of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I assembled a dataset of 1,224 projects launched between 2010 and 2014. Within that dataset I found some startling trends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Most people want to donate about $60. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most projects are small scale, less than $20,000. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most projects happen in dense urban areas – especially those with high concentrations of college-educated 25-35 year olds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most common kind of project is a park or a garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also ran into some complex ethical and political questions. Will Civic Crowdfunding deter investment in the long term? Will richer communities benefit more? Unfortunately it’s still too early to know if these are questions, or real problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I came to the conclusion that while donation-based crowdfunding of public goods has benefited a lot of communities already, it raises some tough questions around scale and ethics. It&amp;#39;s great at solving small-scale, uncontroversial issues - because who doesn&amp;#39;t love a park - but it hasn’t yet proven it can solve, big, hard problems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where do we go from here?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started to look at the incumbent mechanisms of financing public goods. Tax dollars, municipal budgets, and what to me was the elephant in the room – municipal bonds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now perhaps it didn&amp;#39;t take me so long to get to muni bonds because between 2004 and 2006, I was reporting on the bond markets at Bloomberg News in london. This was the time when we were just starting to wake up to what goes wrong when people stop understanding how debt markets should work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you familiar with how US cities and public agencies finance themselves using the bond market? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I&amp;#39;ll give you an overview. Public agencies raise $1bn a day for everything from school improvements to transport infrastructure. The New York Canals were funded by bonds. The Golden Gate Bridge was funded by bonds. In a bond deal, a city gets a loan, promises to pay a fixed interest-rate and in theory, any one of us can invest. It should be a fantastic, open way to produce public goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But bonds today are a very Wall Street kind of thing. Call a broker and get in line. If you&amp;#39;re a high-rolling client you might just get a piece of the action. In fact the two are so intertwined that back in January, Texas Public Schools had to pause closing an investment deal because of storms in New York. True story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;#39;t always used to be that way. Half a century ago, public officials used to stand on the courthouse steps to sell bonds for public projects. They called on the crowd to pitch in, and the crowd were repaid for their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what if we could connect the excitement and energy generated by donation-based crowdfunding to the much bigger, older problem of how to provide infrastructure? And in the process, reconnect people to their cities?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now unknown to me, Neighborly, one of the donation-based platforms I studied while at MIT, had actually started out planning to help reform the muni bond market. But back in Neighborly they found investors were not as enthusiastic about disrupting the financial services industry as they are now, and the team was unable to raise funding for the idea. So Neighborly decided to get started with the donation crowdfunding model, which was better understood. In two years Neighborly raised $2.5 million for donation-based crowdfunding projects. Of course the team found exactly what I had – that donation-based crowdfunding matches small needs much better than large ones. So after two years of proving the crowd could be marshaled for civic purposes, their founder Jase Wilson returned to the idea of opening up public finance on a bigger scale. When Jase told me about their plans, it was obvious to me that I needed to be involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We agreed that because tax-free municipal bonds are a great investment as well as a civic good, they can go much, much further in improving cities. Retail investors buy more municipal bonds every week than Kickstarter has raised in its 6 year history. The main challenge is getting those bonds out of the hands of brokers and into the hands of those households.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a couple of months, we&amp;#39;re going to be opening the first truly accessible investments in US cities. Our goal is to give more people than ever before the chance to both contribute to and benefit from investment in public goods, and to break down layers of markets that depend on flipping to make a profit at every stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, this is very much the spirit of civic crowdfunding. It&amp;#39;s not limited to a donation-based campaigns. It&amp;#39;s the opening up of inaccessible financial processes to involve everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#39;s really gratifying for me personally is that we&amp;#39;re already hearing that we&amp;#39;re not the only ones who have been through this thought process around earlier models of crowdfunding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we asked some of our users the question, why did you sign up for Neighborly, one wrote:
&amp;quot;Do something better with my money than funding another piece of lame technology on Kickstarter.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;d like to leave you with the thought that as we sit here thinking about the future of funding cities, we need to consider all of the tools we have in our armory. Old and new.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve passed through the first phase of trying to connect this idea to public goods and cities. I think the next phase calls on us to think bigger and bolder. I&amp;#39;m really excited to have today&amp;#39;s conversation with you and to hear more about what you&amp;#39;re working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you for listening, and I look forward to continuing the conversation. &lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Is Airbnb a civic tech company, a peace tech company, or neither?</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/airbnb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past two weeks, I&amp;#39;ve been to two events at which a speaker suggested Airbnb is a de facto social impact technology company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On April 14, former DC mayor &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/amfenty&quot;&gt;Adrian Fenty&lt;/a&gt; included Airbnb in a map of civic technology companies that &lt;a href=&quot;http://a16z.com&quot;&gt;Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/a&gt; (whom he advises) has invested in in a presentation at Civic Hall in New York. Eleven days later, in Nicosia, Cyprus, &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/mark__nelson&quot;&gt;Mark Nelson of the Stanford Peace Innovation Lab&lt;/a&gt; suggested in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://howtobuildpeace.org&quot;&gt;Build Peace&lt;/a&gt; panel that Airbnb was the largest peace technology company in the world, because it enables users to stay in the homes of strangers from other cultures (Full disclosure: I am a co-director of &lt;a href=&quot;http://howtobuildup.org&quot;&gt;Build Up&lt;/a&gt;, which organizes Build Peace).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adrian and Mark&amp;#39;s comments were divisive in two strikingly similar ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, some people felt the comparison was lazy, and risked diluting their field&amp;#39;s identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some ways I empathize with this point of view. It&amp;#39;s possible, but unproven that Airbnb&amp;#39;s success has led to greater cross-cultural and cross-racial contact, and therefore has promoted peaceful international relations. On the other hand, use of the platform could replicate existing cultural ties or encourage homophily, a trend that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/rewire-digital-cosmopolitans-in-the-age-of-connection&quot;&gt;Ethan Zuckerman has observed among many online communities&lt;/a&gt;. Are white hosts are more likely to receive white guests than those of other races, or is the opposite true? I don&amp;#39;t know the answer, and can&amp;#39;t form an opinion on racial and cultural interaction on Airbnb without looking at the data. We should ask questions and seek data before lionizing Airbnb for something to which even the company itself does not lay claim. Similarly, we should decide on indicators of the civic role that Airbnb might play before giving the platform another unasked-for label. We might ask a question like &amp;quot;Are Airbnb guests more likely to talk positively about their host city as a result of using the platform than hotel guests?&amp;quot; Civic technologists and peacebuilders could learn a lot from a dataset as rich as Airbnb&amp;#39;s by asking hard questions that are core to those fields. Doing so will put all of us in a stronger position to make provocative claims without being accused of losing sight of a field&amp;#39;s identity and mission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, some were irritated by what they perceived as an attempt to steer their field towards for-profit business models at the expense of work for which the ROI is much harder to quantify.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;#39;t get into the complexity of measuring impact and ROI and impact in civic and peacebuilding projects here (that&amp;#39;s a vast subject), but I think almost everyone can acknowledge that not all civic and peacebuilding projects are capable of being for-profit enterprises. Neither do I think that either Adrian or Mark was suggesting that all projects should be structured as for-profit businesses. Rather, I take from their comments two important observations: first, that there is a lot that civic and peace tech companies can learn from the success of private sector tech startups, and second, that in many cases outcomes like peace and civic engagement are secondary outcomes that result from improving people&amp;#39;s quality of life, and that those improvements are the space in which we should be spending much more of our time. There are plenty of folks in civic and peace tech who should be paying attention to these observations, and who are evidently not doing so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you learning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s start with what civic and peace tech companies can learn from startups. Ideas that are considered necessary for survival as a private sector tech startup are often absent from civic and peace tech projects. Authentic &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design&quot;&gt;user-centered design&lt;/a&gt; is hard to do when your organization or sponsor is a vast bureaucracy with a hierarchical culture. &lt;a href=&quot;http://agilemanifesto.org&quot;&gt;Agile software development&lt;/a&gt; is almost impossible when you have an RFP process that looks like it was written by the 19th century British civil service. Civic tech is making great progress in changing culture and process from within and outside bureaucracies, thanks to awesome organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;http://18f.gsa.gov&quot;&gt;18F&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://codeforamerica.org&quot;&gt;Code for America&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.whitehouse.gov/digital/united-states-digital-service&quot;&gt;US Digital Service&lt;/a&gt;. Peace tech seems to be having a much harder time modernizing. That&amp;#39;s not wholly surprising, since peacebuilding has been around for longer, and hierarchical, bureacratic culture permeates down from large institutions to smaller organizations as a result of funding relationships. That dynamic is less common in civic tech because government funding of civic tech is a pretty recent phenomenon. There are of course some peacebuilding organizations, large and small, that are embracing flexible, modern ways of working, but making this transition is difficult. Done right, these methods challenge conventional organizational structures. But the results in technology projects speak for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The modernizers in civic and peace tech aren&amp;#39;t all for-profit organizations – they&amp;#39;re picking the best methods that have been proven in the for-profit sector and adapting them to their mission. If you&amp;#39;re building a piece of software, you need a robust product development paradigm whether or not that application users are sharing photos, participating in conflict resolution, or contributing to their community. Following the practices the for-profit sector takes for granted will also give you a much wider selection of talent to work with, instead of being restricted to the pool of contractors who have spent more time learning the art of government / development procurement jujitsu than the job you&amp;#39;re hiring them for. Guess what? That probably means lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let the problem serve the mission&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, what about the assumption that peace or civic engagement should be the primary objective of a peace or civic tech company? Is Airbnb excluded from being a civic or peace tech company because its primary mission is neither civic engagement nor peace? I don&amp;#39;t think so. At &lt;a href=&quot;http://neighborly.com&quot;&gt;Neighborly&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;re passionate about civic engagement, reconnecting people and cities and helping to build better public infrastructure. But we&amp;#39;re not building a civic engagement platform. &lt;a href=&quot;http://neighborly.com/how-it-works&quot;&gt;We&amp;#39;re building a community investment marketplace to allow people to invest in their city through municipal bonds&lt;/a&gt;. Our goal is to bring low-risk tax-free investment opportunities that are currently dominated by the wealthy to everyone, and to drastically reduce the amount that cities pay to finance infrastructure by giving them an alternative to the manifold gatekeepers and middlemen they currently have to work with. We believe that solving those two problems will increase civic engagement and make cities more resilient in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that&amp;#39;s the way it should be for any civic or peace tech company. Start with the problem you&amp;#39;re addressing, not your desire to deliver a more peaceful world or a more civically engaged population. You can&amp;#39;t solve peace or civic engagement because neither is a single problem. They&amp;#39;re both, quite obviously, made up of thousands of interconnected problems. If you pick one of those problems and you do your job well, you&amp;#39;ll be doing the best you can to help create a more peaceful and engaged world. You&amp;#39;ll be a peace tech company or a civic tech company, and not just because that&amp;#39;s a label you apply to your work. Don&amp;#39;t be another civic engagement platform or peacebuilding platform solution in search of a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So is Airbnb a civic or a peace tech company? It didn&amp;#39;t set out to solve a civic or peace-related problem, but it may be doing so. We shouldn&amp;#39;t rule out that possibility. We should just ask better questions. If Airbnb isn&amp;#39;t increasing civic engagement and/or promoting peace but you believe it could, offer to partner and help the company realize its potential. On the other hand, if Airbnb is leading to a more civically engaged, peaceful world, ask yourself what their team is doing that your organization is not. &lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>A New Way to Invest in Communities</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/ggb.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the past couple of years I&amp;#39;ve been thinking about how to bring the energy, potential and ambition of donation/reward crowdfunding to community development and civic engagement. I was lucky to be an early employee of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.spacehive.com&quot;&gt;Spacehive&lt;/a&gt;, one of the first movers in the space, I put together the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2434615&quot;&gt;study of the field&lt;/a&gt; (with the help of &lt;a href=&quot;http://civiccrowdfunding.com&quot;&gt;Ethan&lt;/a&gt; and others at MIT), and I got to watch as the idea of civic crowdfunding caught the attention of the media, researchers, and finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/government/news/prime-minister-hails-the-rise-of-civic-crowdfunding&quot;&gt;heads of state&lt;/a&gt;. I got to watch some incredible people &lt;a href=&quot;http://spacehive.com/glyncochcc&quot;&gt;make change for their neighborhoods&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://catarse.me/pt/pimpmycarroca&quot;&gt;their communities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there were two questions that often gave me pause. First, should we be funding civic projects through philanthropy, and does the success of that undermine public investment? Second, is it realistic to expect philanthropic crowds to raise the large sums that are often necessary to improve a community&amp;#39;s quality of life? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first question is a judgement call for which I&amp;#39;ve seen persuasive arguments on both sides. On the second question, I&amp;#39;ve seen very few cases that persuade me that the answer is yes. That&amp;#39;s not to say donation/reward civic crowdfunding doesn&amp;#39;t have a bright future in some respects. It has proven itself to be a robust way to produce small-scale change, especially in urban communities. As I&amp;#39;ve argued many times before, if non-profits start to take donation/reward crowdfunding seriously as a tactic, it has the potential to transform that sector and energize a whole new generation of small-dollar philanthropists. I will continue to work with and advise organizations who are considering donation-based civic crowdfunding for the right projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there are other methods of financing community development that can give a much stronger &amp;#39;yes&amp;#39; to that second question, the question of scale. One of those is a very old form of crowd-based finance: municipal bonds. For just over two centuries, U.S. cities have been using them to finance critical improvements, from transport infrastructure, to schools, to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://goldengatebridge.org/research/BondMeasure.php&quot;&gt;Golden Gate Bridge&lt;/a&gt;. Municipal bonds give individuals the opportunity to invest in improvements to their city, while receiving predictable, tax-free returns every year, and, at the end of the bond (often 5-10 years), the individual gets his or her money back. They don&amp;#39;t offer the theoretically sky-high returns of stocks, but they do offer tax-efficient returns at very low risk (the default rate on municipal bonds is close to 1 in 1,000). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Municipal bonds should be easy, sleep-at-night investments that allow you to contribute to your community directly. The problem is, they&amp;#39;re not. At this moment in time, buying a municipal bond is complicated and expensive, in the U.S. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.iriomk.com/post/104125235983/a-melhor-forma-de-nao-investir-em-titulos-publicos&quot;&gt;and elsewhere&lt;/a&gt;. Those who have wealth and the right broker are buying them, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bondbuyer.com/news/washington-taxation/sen-coburn-eliminate-the-muni-tax-exemption-1068624-1.html&quot;&gt;benefiting disproportionately&lt;/a&gt; because the market is effectively closed to the average person. People are starting to realize that they&amp;#39;re missing out, and when cities do open up their bond issuances, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26272746/denvers-500-mini-bonds-sell-out-first-hour&quot;&gt;they sell out fast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re heading towards an inflection point, and I&amp;#39;m certainly not the only one to have realized that. &lt;a href=&quot;https://neighborly.com&quot;&gt;Neighborly&lt;/a&gt;, which was one of the pioneers in the donation-based civic crowdfunding space, is building a platform to allow individuals and households to invest directly in their cities by buying bonds. So I&amp;#39;ve decided to join the team as Head of Product to help make that happen. I&amp;#39;m taking leave from my research because I think we&amp;#39;re at a critical moment in deciding the future path of community development, and I want to be in the front seat with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://neighbor.ly/about&quot;&gt;fantastic team&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/luminopolis&quot;&gt;Jase&lt;/a&gt; has put together. It&amp;#39;s also a fun return to a subject I once spent a lot of time on: my first job out of college was reporting on government bonds and currency markets for Bloomberg News in London. So all that studying of yield curves and ratings scales is coming in very handy once again, a decade later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From now on, I&amp;#39;ll be writing more about how municipal bonds work (and don&amp;#39;t work), and soon we&amp;#39;ll be giving you the chance to invest directly in your community through Neighborly. Come and join us on this new path.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Three Provocations for Civic Crowdfunding</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/3.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://www.fotopedia.com/users/R53-8VoCz0M&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week I&amp;#39;m in Daegu, Korea, and on Thursday (23rd October) will be giving a talk at the annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://ir15.aoir.org/&quot;&gt;Association of Internet Researchers conference (AoIR)&lt;/a&gt;, titled &amp;quot;Three Provocations for Civic Crowdfunding.&amp;quot; If you&amp;#39;re in Daegu, do stop by the session or find me around the event. If you&amp;#39;re not in Daegu, I&amp;#39;ll update this post with my slides before Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m excited to be part of a panel called &amp;quot;Commodification and Crowdsourcing&amp;quot;, with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wishcrys.com/&quot;&gt;Crystal Abidin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://dbrabham.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Daren Brabham&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=608&amp;amp;f_id=35&quot;&gt;Andrew Herman&lt;/a&gt;. Daren is one of the few other researchers I&amp;#39;ve found who is paying attention to the sociological aspects of crowdfunding, and he&amp;#39;s going to be talking about the impact of crowdfunding discourse on public funding for the arts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since AoIR format is short papers, I&amp;#39;ve included the full text below. An extended version will hopefully be appearing in print over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three Provocations for Civic Crowdfunding: AoIR 15, Daegu, Korea&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid rise of crowdfunding in the past five years, most prominently among US-based platforms such as Kickstarter and IndieGoGo, has begun to attract the attention of a wide range of scholars, policymakers and practitioners. As the industry evolves, it is developing a range of specialist sub-genres and platforms, from politics to manufacturing. This paper considers civic crowdfunding – the use of crowdfunding for projects that produce community or quasi-public assets – and argues that its emergence demands a fresh set of questions and approaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scholarly analyses of crowdfunding to date have centered on fields such as investment finance, and Computer-Supported Co-operative Work (CSCW). While these inquiries have begun to build a frameworks for understanding the dynamics of the fundraising process and participants&amp;#39; motivations, there is yet to be substantial work considering the socio-political context and broader implications of crowdfunding. These questions are necessarily more pressing and contested when considering the use of crowdfunding for civic projects. The sub-field of `civic crowdfunding&amp;#39; as an application of the model is yet to be defined by academic researchers. The use of the term can be traced to 2012, and is used by platforms such as Spacehive and Neighbor.ly (Davies 2014a). This paper uses a mixed-methods case study approach to highlight and analyze critical cases in civic crowdfunding. It draws on quantitative analysis of project fundraising data drawn from four platforms (Citizinvestor, IOBY, Neighbo.ly and Spacehive), participant interviews and discourse analysis of projects&amp;#39; promotional material. In so doing it posits three provocations for the future study of civic crowdfunding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, to what extent is civic crowdfunding participatory? It can be a truly organic mechanism that is a new tool available to activists. In Sao Paulo, Brazil, the graffiti artist Mundano raised $27,000 on the Catarse platform in May 2012 --- twice the campaign&amp;#39;s original target --- to paint the carts of waste pickers, as a means of highlighting their contribution to the city&amp;#39;s environmental sustainability and advocating for new labor protections for them. The idea that crowdfunding is a form of participation as well as a funding mechanism is salient since civic crowdfunding has emerged after a decade of experimentation with symbolic money as a representation of agency through participatory budgeting, most prominently in Brazil and New York City. But most crowdfunding platforms do not support the kind of deliberative process that would be expected in a participatory democratic structure: by the time a campaign is published on a platform, the idea is expected to be fully formed. Furthemore, since donations vary in size and offer differential agencies, the field is open to the charge that it may become dominated by resourced interests. Several of the largest civic crowdfunding campaigns to date have drawn the majority of their funding not from a high volume, low-donation value crowd, but from wealthier donors. For example, Kansas City&amp;#39;s B-Cycle program, partially crowdfunded on Neighbor.ly, drew 99% of its funding from six backers who donated more than $5,000 each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, does civic crowdfunding exacerbate or reduce economic inequality? At the case level, there are clear examples of underserved and privileged communities benefiting from civic crowdfunding in very different ways. In Glyn Coch, South Wales, a community with chronic unemployment and resource challenges, local organizers raised $49,000 to fill a gap in funding for a new community center, most of which was funded by government grants. By contrast, in October 2013, three wealthy suburban communities in Oakland, CA, raised $50,000 on the CrowdTilt platform to crowdfund private security patrols. The campaigns, which emerged within a few days of each other, demonstrated the risk of a &amp;#39;contagion effect&amp;#39; through which resourced communities could use civic crowdfunding campaigns from other localities as templates for building their replacement public services. At the platform level there are more ambiguous indicators with respect to equity. New York and Miami-based platform IOBY is the only platform that explicitly recruits projects from underserved communities. Early findings suggest that IOBY projects occur in neighborhoods with slightly higher poverty rates, but the difference is marginal (Goodspeed and Davies 2014). Citizinvestor finds in its own data that there is no correlation between the likelihood of a project occurring in a neighborhood and that neighborhood&amp;#39;s average household income. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, does civic crowdfunding support or undermine the role of public institutions? In many cases the link between civic crowdfunding and weakened institutions is direct: The bankrupt city of Central Falls, Rhode Island, crowdfunded $20,000 to pay for recycling facilities in Jenks park in November 2013, explicitly citing its financial distress as a motivating factor. Around one in ten projects in the dataset makes reference to shortfalls in public funding, and Brabham has argued that the success of crowdfunding is likely to be a disincentive for public investment in the arts in the future (Davies 2014b, Brabham 2012). Yet on the other hand, civic crowdfunding can also be framed as a mechanism that expands the range of public-private partnerships that are possible, since government can partner with crowdfunded groups. Parklets, a system of allowing individuals and groups to create temporary installations in parking spaces, is one public-private framework that has benefited from crowdfunding. Eleven parklets have been successfully crowdfunded via Kickstarter since April 2012, in Oakland, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle and Vancouver, raising a total of $100,853. In August 2013, the City of San Francisco launched Living Innovation Zones, a program modeled on parklets that invites proposals for a series of underutilized spaces across the city, and encourages prospective groups to consider crowdfunding. Public-private opportunities that embrace crowdfunding as a potential tool are nascent, but are gaining in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of these three provocations is highly context-specific and as yet the signals from the available data and reported cases are mixed and often conflicting. Nevertheless, they underscore the importance of approaching civic crowdfunding as a socio-politically located and contested phenomenon, and offer pathways for researchers to begin to critically analyze and define the field. Future research work on civic crowdfunding that considers its institutional and political context is likely to be highly generative across disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Crowdfunding Cities as Collaborative Innovation</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/merge.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://www.fotopedia.com/users/R53-8VoCz0M&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today at the Academy of Management&amp;#39;s Annual Meeting in Philadelphia some colleagues and I will be giving a panel titled &lt;a href=&quot;http://program.aom.org/2014/submission.asp?mode=ShowSession&amp;amp;SessionID=1026&quot;&gt;Towards Government 2.0: Open Data and Innovation through Cross-Sector Collaboration&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;#39;re going to be talking about open data, building better and more open government services, and how to foster civic collaboration across sectors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I won&amp;#39;t be at the meeting in person (I&amp;#39;m in the midst of relocating to San Francisco), so I&amp;#39;ve contributed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbnQHKdIwLY&quot;&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; in which I talk about some of the work I&amp;#39;ve done on crowdfunding in cities. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m interested in how crowdfunding can be a means not just of getting something done (i.e. a funding mechanism), but a means of getting something done in a particular way: collaboratively. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The crowd in a crowdfunding campaign collaborates ambiently – by contributing in the same place, they benefit from mutual awareness and together create a movement that has momentum. But in civic crowdfunding there&amp;#39;s also another layer of possible collaboration, between the crowd and cities, because cities are likely to have an interest in almost any project that provides a service to a local community. That interest could be regulatory (the city regulates the use of a particular kind of space or activity), or it could be participatory (the city wants to know what&amp;#39;s going on and to support good ideas). Those interests could be construed positively or negatively, depending on the relationship between the city and the project participants – the city could be perceived as supportive and welcoming, or heavy-handed and interfering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crowdfunding has the potential to help structure those relationships positively, if cities and project owners approach the project in the right way. The substance of my talk, which you can check out below, is to give four suggestions for how cities can frame structure their involvement in civic crowdfunding projects to deliver the best outcomes. You&amp;#39;ll also be able to read more on this in &lt;a href=&quot;http://rodrigodavies.com/civiccrowdfunding&quot;&gt;an upcoming collection I&amp;#39;m contributing to on Smarter Cities&lt;/a&gt;, edited by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esade.edu/faculty/esteve.almirall&quot;&gt;Esteve Almirall&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://boydcohen.com&quot;&gt;Boyd Cohen&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As ever, your comments and feedback are much appreciated. Now that I&amp;#39;m in the Bay Area, if you&amp;#39;re local and working on similar topics, please reach out. &lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>What's Crowdfunding (and What's Not)</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/lonely.png&quot; alt=&quot;http://www.fotopedia.com/users/R53-8VoCz0M&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I came across a fundraising campaign by a consortium of non-profits in the US earlier this year to raise money over a short period of time. Participating organizations were ranked in a public ranking, and competed for prizes based on the amount they raised and the number of donors they attracted. A running total of the overall amount donated was published on the site. The effort was fairly successful, and raised close to a million dollars for over 300 organizations. The most successful organization raised over $25,000, although one-fifth of participating organizations raised zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The initiative was described to me as being similar to crowdfunding, likely because of its gamified flavor. Although the folks behind it weren&amp;#39;t using the language of crowdfunding, several observers were. But it wasn&amp;#39;t crowdfunding, and there are a number of important reasons why.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I get into that, let&amp;#39;s be clear: I&amp;#39;m not making a point about the technical definition of the term &lt;em&gt;crowdfunding&lt;/em&gt;. My critique is not that this initiative missed many opportunities to create a compelling campaign that crowdfunders and crowdfunding platforms make use of every day. The following criticisms are not specific to this case, either. They&amp;#39;re common problems among inexperienced (and reluctant) online fundraisers, particularly in the non-profit space. That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;m not going to name the initiative here, instead I&amp;#39;m going to refer to it as Acme Non-Profit Initiative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the biggest problems I observed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There was no crowd&lt;/strong&gt;. One of the main distinguishing elements of crowdfunding is the mutual awareness of donors. It&amp;#39;s what reminds us that we&amp;#39;re not acting alone (breaking down &amp;#39;pluralistic ignorance&amp;#39;), and gives us a sense of belonging. Acme Non-Profit Initiative&amp;#39;s website did not show any identifying information about other donors, simply the numbers. It was not, as far as I can tell, able to interface with donors&amp;#39; Facebook and Twitter accounts directly to enable them to see which of their friends had already donated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There were no projects&lt;/strong&gt;. The prompt for donation was a one paragraph description of the organization, with a selection of links. There was no clear sense of what projects the organizations were raising money for at this particular time, and what stage they were at. It&amp;#39;s not true that crowdfunding can never be used to pay for overhead costs. If these costs are given as part of a project budget, backers won&amp;#39;t flee. Backers understand that it costs money to keep the lights on, but they&amp;#39;re most interested what&amp;#39;s happening in the building. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There were no targets&lt;/strong&gt;. Besides a number of prizes given to the most successful organizations, there was no sense of what the organizations and the crowd should be aiming for. As a result, there were no metrics for success and no sense of achievement, no matter how well the initiative went. Having the courage to set a target and asking the crowd to help you reach it is part of the interaction and engagement that crowdfunding demands. You&amp;#39;re asking the crowd to take a risk with you by backing your project, and in return your organization is taking a risk by putting its goals and ideas out in public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The donation data wasn&amp;#39;t transparent&lt;/strong&gt;. I found that the total fundraising numbers being reported didn&amp;#39;t correspond with the itemized data. I presume that&amp;#39;s because additional funds were raised during the initiative but given directly, instead of through the platforms. That&amp;#39;s not unusual, but it raises red flags with potential donors when organizations provide incomplete data. A simple line that explained that a certain percentage of funds were given directly or in person would be enough. Being loose with the published numbers undermines the credibility of the initiative and doesn&amp;#39;t meet the standards of transparency people rightly associate with crowdfunding. We should continue to demand that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As crowdfunding increasingly becomes used as a catch-all term for all kinds of online fundraising, we&amp;#39;re in danger of missing the point. That danger particularly applies to organizations who already fundraise regularly, and may be under the impression that all they need to do to take advantage of crowdfunding is to digitize, verbatim, their existing processes. The history of technological change has taught us time after time that that won&amp;#39;t work. New technologies reshape and restructure processes and organizations, whether they like it or not. And, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philanthropy.blogspot.com/2014/05/civil-society-is-missing-boat-on-issues.html&quot;&gt;as Lucy Bernholz put it recently&lt;/a&gt;, we&amp;#39;re foolish to think that non-profits will be any different. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;#39;s great to see so many innovative twists on the crowdfunding model emerge, we need to be sure that we&amp;#39;re not calling things crowdfunding that are really not worthy of the term – and then being disappointed when those initiatives don&amp;#39;t deliver the engagement their creators are hoping for. When done correctly, crowdfunding is bold, risky and open, and it demands those same qualities from backers and creators alike. &lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Civic Crowdfunding – Four Things We Know, Two Things We Don't</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/thesis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2434615&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I&amp;#39;m capping &lt;a href=&quot;http://rodrigodavies.com/civiccrowdfunding/&quot;&gt;two years of studying the emergence of civic crowdfunding&lt;/a&gt; by submitting my master&amp;#39;s thesis to the MIT archives. Great thanks are due to the wonderful collaborators I&amp;#39;ve had the privilege of working with. I won&amp;#39;t name everyone here, but all of you folks will find your names in the Acknowledgments section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can read &lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2434615&quot;&gt;Civic Crowdfunding: Participatory Communities, Entrepreneurs and the Political Economy of Place&lt;/a&gt; in its entirety (173 pages) now, and if you do so, I&amp;#39;d love to hear your feedback. Before you get to that, though, here are some of the most important things I learned about civic crowdfunding, and a few thoughts on where we&amp;#39;re headed next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crowdfunding is everywhere. People are using it to fund watches, comic books, even famous film directors are doing it. In what is now a $6 billion industry globally, I think the most interesting, disruptive and exciting work that&amp;#39;s happening is in donation-based crowdfunding. That’s worth, very roughly, $1.2 billion a year worldwide per year. Within that subset, I’ve been looking at civic projects, people who are producing shared goods for a community or broader public. These projects build on &lt;a href=&quot;http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2014/04/28/the-digital-pollada-or-what-i-learned-about-crowdfunding-from-peruvian-chicken.html&quot;&gt;histories of community fundraising and resource pooling that long predate the Internet&lt;/a&gt;; what’s changed is that we’ve created a scalable, portable platform model to carry out these existing practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how is civic crowdfunding doing? When I started this project very few people were using that term. No one had done any aggregated data collection and published it. So I decided to take on that task. I collected data on 1224 projects between 2010 and March 2014, which raised $10.74 million in just over three years. I focused on seven platforms: Catarse (Brazil), Citizinvestor (US), Goteo (Spain), IOBY (US), Kickstarter (US), Neighbor.ly (US) and Spacehive (UK). I didn’t collect everything. There’s a new crowdfunding site every week that may or may not have a few civic projects on it. If you&amp;#39;re interested in my methodology, check out Chapter 2. I don’t pretend to have captured every civic project that has ever existed, but I&amp;#39;m working with a representative sample. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are four things I found out about civic crowdfunding. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civic crowdfunding is small-scale but relatively successful, and it has big ambitions.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently the average civic crowdfunding project is small in scale: $6,357 is the median amount raised. But these civic projects seem to be doing pretty well. Projects tagged &amp;#39;civic&amp;#39; on Kickstarter, for instance, succeed 81% of the time. If Civic were a separate category, it would be Kickstarter’s most successful category. Meanwhile, most platform owners and some incumbent institutions see civic crowdfunding as a new mechanism for public-private partnerships capable of realizing large-scale projects. In a small minority of cases, such as the three edge-case projects I explored in Chapter 3 of my thesis, civic crowdfunding has begun to fulfill some of those ambitions. For the center of gravity to shift further in the direction of these potential outcomes, though, existing institutions, including government, large non-profits and the for-profit sector, will need to engage more comprehensively with the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civic crowdfunding started as a hobby for green space projects by local non-profits, but larger organizations are getting involved.&lt;/strong&gt; Almost a third of campaigners are using civic crowdfunding platforms for park and garden-related projects (29%). Event-based projects, and education and training are also popular. Sports and mobility projects are pretty uncommon. The frequency of garden and park projects is partly because these projects are not capital intensive, and they&amp;#39;re uncontroversial. That&amp;#39;s also changing. Organizations from governments to corporations and large foundations, are exploring ways to support crowdfunding for &lt;a href=&quot;http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2014/03/24/hawaii-proposes-the-first-civic-crowdfunding-bill.html&quot;&gt;a much wider range of community-facing activities&lt;/a&gt;. Their modes of engagement include &lt;a href=&quot;http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2013/07/23/four-roles-civic-organizations-can-play-in-crowdfunding.html&quot;&gt;publicizing campaigns, match-funding campaigns on an ad-hoc basis, running their own campaigns and even building new platforms from the ground up&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civic crowdfunding is concentrated in cities (especially those where platforms are based).&lt;/strong&gt; The genre is too new to have spread very effectively, it seems. Five states account for 80% of the projects, and this is partly a function of where the platforms are located. New York, California are our top two, followed by Illinois and Oregon. We know there’s a strong trend towards big cities. It&amp;#39;s hard work for communities to use crowdfunding to get projects off the ground, especially when it&amp;#39;s an unfamiliar process. The platforms have played a critical role in building participants&amp;#39; understanding of crowdfunding and supporting them through the process. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Civic crowdfunding has the same highly unequal distributional tendencies as other crowd markets.&lt;/strong&gt; When we look at the size distribution of projects, the first thing we notice is something close to a Pareto distribution, or Long Tail. Most projects are small-scale, but a small number of high-value projects have taken a large share of the total revenue raised by civic crowdfunding. We shouldn’t be surprised by this. On Kickstarter most successful projects are between 5 and 10k, and 47% of civic projects I studied are in the same bracket. &lt;a href=&quot;http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2013/11/21/spreading-the-crowdfunded-wealth.html&quot;&gt;The problem is that we tend to remember the outliers, such as Veronica Mars and Spike Lee – because they show what’s possible&lt;/a&gt;. But they are still the outliers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, here are two things we don’t know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will civic crowdfunding deter public investment or encourage it?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will civic crowdfunding widen wealth gaps?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have enough high-quality data, and not enough time has passed, to answer these questions satisfactorily yet. There are some clues in the rhetoric people use, which I explore in Chapter 4 of my thesis, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2014/03/23/is-civic-crowdfunding-participatory-citizenship-or-a-sign-of-institutions-in-decline.html&quot;&gt;they point in many different, contradictory directions&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, there are concrete goals we can work towards to try and make the answers to those two questions positive ones for community development and society more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Communities and the groups that serve them, in the government and social sector, are in an important position to influence how crowdfunding evolves. It can just as easily become a part of the toolkit for community organizing and be a mechanism for getting resources to places where they’re needed as it can be to do the opposite. I’ve been involved as a workshop leader and advisor in trying to help support some of this activity, but we’re really just getting started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To really understand what’s going on, especially over the longer term, we need better data. We need to know more precisely when projects are happening, if they’re succeeding, and by what measure. And we need to be able to know how what’s happening in crowdfunding relates to the other things we measure. We can’t build civic engagement and awareness on the back of bad data. This is something I’m actively working on with the platforms I’ve worked with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we need more socially-grounded research in this space. It&amp;#39;s one of the things I&amp;#39;m going to be spending my time on at Stanford over the next five years. I&amp;#39;m excited about advancing qualitative inquiry to support the quantitative analysis we’re doing, research that helps us understand how crowdfunding is changing the ways that organizations and the people within them work. We know crowdfunding is not just a numbers game, it’s a very human and complex game, and I look forward to continuing to help us understand it better.&lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>The Digital Pollada, or What I Learned About Crowdfunding from Peruvian Chicken</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/chicken.png&quot; alt=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/izik/2610556819/&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s a tradition in Peru called the &lt;em&gt;pollada&lt;/em&gt; – literally, a chicken party. These parties perform a very important social function. Say I’m about to have a child and I’m worried about how I’m going to pay education or healthcare bills. I hold a pollada to raise money by inviting friends and family around for chicken and beers, and selling tickets to the event. The tickets are usually priced fairly highly. The friends who come to my party are willing to pay more than they would normally, because they know they’re contributing to my family&amp;#39;s welfare. Together, we fund the future of my family’s education. And we eat. And we bond. We form our own little crowd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like web-based crowdfunding, the pollada is a clever framing of the process of bringing people together to collaborate on a project. Just like a public crowdfunding campaign, the high level of mutual visibility at a pollada – we&amp;#39;re contributing (and partying) side by side with each other – is critical to its success. That mutual visibility &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/matter/76d9913c6011&quot;&gt;breaks down &amp;quot;pluralistic ignorance&amp;quot;&lt;/a&gt;, the anxiety that we&amp;#39;re acting alone. It reinforces our sense of membership and produces the social benefits associated with belonging. One of the best explanations of these benefits is provided by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nyu.edu/projects/nissenbaum/papers/jopp_235.pdf&quot;&gt;Benkler and Nissenbaum&amp;#39;s work on commons-based peer production&lt;/a&gt;. Crowdfunding and the pollada most clearly convey what they call Cluster III benefits (benevolence, charity, generosity, altruism) and Cluster IV benefits (sociability, camaraderie, friendship, cooperation, civic virtue).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the pollada is an important reminder that mutual awareness is an essential aspect of crowdfunding. It is one of the few characteristics of crowdfunding that fundamentally differentiates it from individuated fundraising. Every website that includes a donation button is not a crowdfunding website, because you can&amp;#39;t form a crowd in which the members are entirely invisible to each other. Members may be anonymous, their locations may be dispersed or unknown, but their co-presence must be evident. A pollada is not a pollada if we&amp;#39;re all enjoying chicken on our own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about the pollada this past week when I visited Peru with some colleagues from MIT, and used it as a way to contextualize crowdfunding in two different talks I gave to &lt;a href=&quot;http://yolab.us/possible-futures/&quot;&gt;Intercorp&amp;#39;s new Innovation Lab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://hastac2014.org&quot;&gt;HASTAC 2014&lt;/a&gt; in Lima. I used it to make the argument that crowdfunding is a process that is rooted in collaborative practices that are common across cultures, and that everything we know about making these practices effective is the raw material of great crowdfunding. For a Peruvian audience, the pollada was a familiar practice that made crowdfunding --- still a relatively new and untested phenomenon in the country --- immediately intuitive. For non-Peruvians, the comparison served to demonstrate the array of socio-cultural precedents that exist for crowdfunding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if the foundations of crowdfunding are deeply rooted, what does that tell us about the future evolution of crowdfunding? What do we know about the way that societies typically organize themselves that might apply to crowdfunding? At Intercorp I argued that there are three key trends emerging in crowdfunding, each of which presents different opportunities for project owners, for platforms, for donors large and small, and for organizations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowdfunding is becoming specialized&lt;/strong&gt;. Whereas sites like Kickstarter will let a big range of projects all happen in one place – from films to video games to technology – sometimes you need to connect to people with particular expertise or interest. For example, if you want to attract support for a high-level scientific project, you could use a site like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.experiment.com&quot;&gt;Experiment&lt;/a&gt; to reach the scientific community. Or perhaps you want to reach a niche interest group such as healthcare. &lt;a href=&quot;http://possiblehealth.org&quot;&gt;Nyaya Health&lt;/a&gt; funds medical care for patients in Nepal, seeking funding from around the world. Or perhaps you want to create a public or community service, a process that may require many more steps and legal structures than conventional crowdfunding provides. As I&amp;#39;ve written about frequently on this site and elsewhere, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civiccrowdfunding.com&quot;&gt;new civic crowdfunding platforms&lt;/a&gt; have emerged to support complex public-private projects like community centers, bikeshare schemes, and public parks. So what is the purpose of specialization? It is an opportunity to isolate and reach a very specific audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowdfunding is becoming local&lt;/strong&gt;. Organizations in countries outside the US and Europe are making their own platforms. Why? Because local circumstances really matter. For all the apparent ability of the internet to bridge geographic boundaries, a lot of crowdfunding is actually pretty local. There are critical issues like currency and language. But there&amp;#39;s also the challenge of dispersed community building. You need to be able to build a community for your projects, and that’s easier to do if the platform and the community are in a relatively small geographic area. My own research has found that civic crowdfunding campaigns are much more likely to occur in cities where platforms are headquartered. And there are some amazing local crowdfunding examples already. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catarse.me&quot;&gt;Catarse&lt;/a&gt;, from Brazil, was the first large-scale crowdfunding platform to open source their code. As a result of that – and their talented developers - they’ve been forked by 10 platforms in the US and elsewhere, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://littlebigmoney.org&quot;&gt;LittleBigMoney&lt;/a&gt; from Colombia, which supports social impact businesses. What this localization of platforms provides is an opportunity to build with a very specific geographic community in mind and to frame the process in a way that is locally intuitive. In Peru, for instance, a pollada-inspired metaphor might seem like a better fit than the `struggling artist&amp;#39; paradigm that is common to Kickstarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crowdfunding is becoming institutional&lt;/strong&gt;. Foundations, corporations or and governments have a lot of experience of and need for fundraising, and now they&amp;#39;re starting to engage with crowdfunding. I described &lt;a href=&quot;http://rodrigodavies.com/blog/2013/10/31/four-models-for-civic-organizations-to-crowdfund.html&quot;&gt;four models of engagement for organizations with respect to crowdfunding&lt;/a&gt;: to be a project promoter, and run projects, to be a curator, and highlight projects that support your goals, to be an investor, and help finance projects directly, or to be a platform, and own the whole process. Each different mode carries with it very different risks and potential rewards, and organizations from startups to municipal governments are experimenting with all of them. This institutionalization of the process is important is that it&amp;#39;s bringing a a lot of new people to the crowdfunding table – to the pollada. And it’s creating new partnerships that cross lines of organizational type, mission and discipline. Those partnerships increase the range and scale of projects that can be crowdfunded dramatically, and hopefully will help recover and regenerate the potential for the public, private and community sectors to work together. Because the best pollada is one to which everyone is invited. &lt;/p&gt;

                                <title>Hawaii Proposes the First Civic Crowdfunding Legislation</title>
                                <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/img/haw-doe.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hawaii has become the first state to propose a bill supporting civic crowdfunding, as it seeks to raise funds for the maintenance and repair of local schools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://legiscan.com/HI/bill/HB2631/2014&quot;&gt;HB2631&lt;/a&gt; outlines a pilot program in which two maintenance projects at Hawaii schools are selected for public crowdfunding campaigns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pilot would be operated by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hawaii3rs.com/about/&quot;&gt;Hawaii 3R&amp;#39;s (Repair, Remode, Restore our Schools)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/431990722&quot;&gt;a 501(c)(3) organization&lt;/a&gt; started by the late Democratic Senator Daniel Inouye in 2001 to raise private funds to contribute to the backlog in school maintenance projects in Hawaii. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how it would work, if approved:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hawaii 3R&amp;#39;s selects the two projects for the pilot, in consultation with the Hawaii department of education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Projects must be &amp;quot;initiated by a member of the community and approved by&amp;quot; the school concerned.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hawaii donates matching funds to Hawaii 3R&amp;#39;s up to a maximum of $50,000 per project.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;10% of the overall funds raised are donated to a Hawaii school that qualifies for Federal Financial Assistance. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill, sponsored by sponsored by &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/bethfukumoto&quot;&gt;Beth Fukumoto&lt;/a&gt; (R), Tom Brower (D), Richard Creagan (D), Aaron Ling Johanson (R) and &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.com/laurencheape&quot;&gt;Lauren Matsumoto&lt;/a&gt; (R), has passed its first reading and has been referred to the education and finance committees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bill does five things that are quite interesting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Firstly, it&amp;#39;s the first legislation to use the term &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.civiccrowdfunding.com&quot;&gt;civic crowdfunding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, the proposers are careful to point out that the pilot builds on an existing fundraising mechanism:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hawaii 3R&amp;#39;s school repair and maintenance fund is an ideal mechanism for a civic crowdfunding pilot program because it already exists to receive private donations for public projects.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method of bolting crowdfunding onto existing public-private models is a strategy I&amp;#39;ve seen used in many other cases, such &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/80192651/outerlands-parklet?ref=live&quot;&gt;crowdfunded parklets&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ioby.org/project/kips-bay-public-plaza&quot;&gt;Plazas in New York&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;#39;s also a welcome reminder that civic crowdfunding is not an entirely new phenomenon, and should be understood in the context of existing public-private fundraising models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thirdly, it mandates the superintendent of education to file a report on the performance of the program no later than 20 days prior to the convening of the 2015 session, including &amp;quot;a recommendation on the feasability of using crowdfunding to fund other projects in the department of education and proposed legislation as may be necessary to permanently implement crowdfunding.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fourthly, it seeks to have a redistributive effect, by donating 10% of funds raised to a low-income school. The obvious short-run question is &amp;#39;how will that school be selected?&amp;#39; but a bigger question is whether or not blind redistribution at the platform level is the best way to direct civic crowdfunding, and how that strategy would be managed with a larger number of schools involved. It could be argued, for example, that an alternative way to encourage redistribution through crowdfunding would be for the government to offer differential match-funding to schools depending on their socio-economic profile. This would have the added benefit of highlighting the work that is happening in those schools and building a connection between donors and lower-income schools. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifthly, it doesn&amp;#39;t give either an estimate of the cost (the figure is blank, likely pending finance committee input) or the technical organization of the civic crowdfunding pilot. Will Hawaii use an existing platform, such as Citizinvestor, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.citizinvestor.com/post/80071292949/civic-crowdfunding-bill-filed-in-hawaii-house-of&quot;&gt;which posted the legislation on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, or will it attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;http://selfstarter.us&quot;&gt;create its own&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.donorschoose.org&quot;&gt;DonorsChoose&lt;/a&gt; might wonder why they were not cited as an example given they are by far the most prominent education crowdfunding platform, although the focus on maintenance rather than classroom supplies may mean the DC model isn&amp;#39;t the right fit for Hawaii&amp;#39;s plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m very interested to track the progress of the bill. If you&amp;#39;re familiar with Hawaii&amp;#39;s education system and have thoughts, I&amp;#39;d love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;
