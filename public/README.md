My blog (rodrigodavies.com/blog)
====

I've been publishing my blog fairly regularly for a year or so using Jekyll and Github pages under a CC-BY-NC license, so I thought it was about time I made the code open too. There's not too much exciting stuff going on here, just another Jekyll site, but if you're curious about my editing process, some of it is captured here.
