**Build Peace**<br>
<img src="../img/bp_logo.png" style="width:90px">[Build Peace](http://buildpeace.org) is a conference that brings together practitioners, activists and technologists from around the world to share experience and ideas on using technology for peacebuilding and conflict transformation. Over the course of two days, we will explore how information and communications technologies, games, networking platforms and other tools can enhance the impact of a broad range of peacebuilding, social cohesion and peace advocacy initiatives. Build Peace is being held at the MIT Media Lab on April 4 and 5, 2014.

**Creative Industries Prototyping Lab**<br>
<img src="../img/cipl.png" style="width:100px">[The Creative Industries Prototyping Lab](http://yolab.us/cipl) is a three-day event where graduate researchers facilitate a series of collaborative and interdisciplinary lectures, workshops and design sessions oriented at thinking and building digital creative industries. Facilitators lead local participants through the potentials and challenges of working in the digital creative industries, and work through a process of critical technology design. The first CIPL will be held in Lima, Peru, in April 2014.

**Civic Crowdfunding Research Project**<br>
<img src="../img/ccrp.png" style="width:100px">[The Civic Crowdfunding Research Project](http://civiccrowdfunding.com) was established at MIT's Center for Civic Media in 2013 to advance socially-grounded research into crowdfunding for civic and community projects.
