Do you know innovators in Latin America? Next month in Lima, Peru, I'll be co-hosting a three-day workshop for entrepreneurs in the creative industries, focused on design thinking, product development and fundraising.

It's an exciting project called [Creative Industries Prototyping Lab](http://yolab.us/cipl), and applications to attend the workshop are open now. We're looking for entrepreneurs who already have the germ of a product or service idea, but are looking to refine their thinking and learn more about how to bring it to market. 

My five collaborators and I are interdisciplinary folks drawn from disciplines such as interactive design, research, UX, video games and educational technology, but one of the areas I'm most excited to talk about is alternative fundraising strategies such as crowdfunding. As regular readers of this blog know, I've written often about the risks associated with crowdfunding and success rates.
